Please Read This Bit Before Reading The Screenplay:



 This is the official 'Unoffical' Monty Python And The Holy Grail screenplay.
This file contains the script as it was on March 20 1974, before filming took
place.  There are many minor differences from what appears here and what
ended up on the screen.
This file also contains cut scenes and lines from the film.


 I tried to preserve as much of the screenplay as possible but it isn't
easy to cross out a section and pencil in new dialogue, in ASCII.
Any Scene or dialogue that was crossed out begins with a "|" before it.
Anything Penciled in has a "+", I also put cut information before penciled in.


 What is interesting about a screenplay is to see what they threw out and
what "Catch Phrases" were literally penciled in.  The reason I keyed in
this file was caused by me downloading current transcript going
around internet.  It was an amazing job... I wouldn't want to have attempted
what he did... But it wasn't in a good script format and I didn't like how
direction was written in. Since I HAD the real screenplay I thought...
What the hell!


 After This I plan to key in "Monty Python's Second Film" it is the 1st draft
of the Holy Grail. It is the script that eventually got canabalized into
sketches for the 4th season of Python.  It Is sill quite different and well
worth a read. is anybody interested in it?????


 Oh yes... I will STRESS this fact once more... THIS IS A SCREENPLAY... So
don't yell at me if a line is paraphrased in the film... This is what was
written before filming took place and it is still quite accurate.


Enough of this...

P.S. TO AHH:  DON'T YOU KNOW WHO CONNIE BOOTH OR CAROL CLEVELAND IS?!?!?!
AND DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT GRAHAM CHAPMAN SOUNDS LIKE?!?!?! Sorry I just had to
say that... As the complete and total bastard that I am.

1  EXTERIOR - CASTLE WALLS - DAY



  Mist.  Several seconds of it swirling about.  silence

  possibly, atmospheric music.  SUPERIMPOSE "England AD 787".

  after a few more seconds we hear hoofbeats in the distance.

  They come slowly closer.  Then out of the mist comes KING ARTHUR

  followed by a SERVANT who is banging two half coconuts

  together.   ARTHUR raises his hand.



                             ARTHUR

      Whoa there!



  SERVANT makes noises of horses halting, with a flourish.  ARTHUR

  peers through the mist.  CUT TO shot from over his shoulder:

  castle (e.g. Bodium) rising out of the mist.  On the castle

  battlements a SOLDIER is dimly seen.  He peers down.



                              SOLDIER

      Halt!  Who goes there?



                              ARTHUR

      It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle

      of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons,

      sovereign of all England!



  Pause.



                              SOLDIER

      Get away!



                              ARTHUR

      I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the

      length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join

      our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.



                              SOLDIER

      What?  Ridden on a horse?



                              ARTHUR

      Yes!



                              SOLDIER

      You're using coconuts!



                              ARTHUR

      ...What?



                              SOLDIER

      You'v
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 16384 --]
e got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging

      them together.



                              ARTHUR

          (Scornfully)

      So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this

      land, through the kingdom of Mercea.



                              SOLDIER

      Where did you get the coconuts?



                              ARTHUR

      Through ... We found them.



                              SOLDIER

      Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!



                              ARTHUR

      What do you mean?



                              SOLDIER

      Well, this is a temperate zone.



                              ARTHUR

      The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin

      or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are

      not strangers to our land.



                              SOLDIER

      Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?



                              ARTHUR

      Not at all.  They could be carried.



                              SOLDIER

      What? A swallow carrying a coconut?



|                               ARTHUR

|       Why not?

|

|                               SOLDIER

|       I'll tell you why not ... because a swallow is about eight

|       inches long and weighs five ounces, and you'd be lucky

|       to find a coconut under a pound.

|



                              ARTHUR

      It could grip it by the husk ...



                              SOLDIER

      It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple

      matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not

      hold a a one pound coconut.



                              ARTHUR

      Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that

      Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.



  A Slight pause.  Swirling mist.  Silence.



                              SOLDIER

      Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat

      its wings four hundred and ninety three times every

      second.   right?



                              ARTHUR

          (irritated)

      Please!



                              SOLDIER

      Am I right?



                              ARTHUR

      I'm not interested.



                              SECOND SOLDIER

          (who has loomed up on the battlements)

      It could be carried by an African swallow!



                              FIRST SOLDIER

      Oh  yes! An African swallow maybe ... but not a European

      swallow. that's my point.



                              SECOND SOLDIER

      Oh yes, I agree there ...



                              ARTHUR

          (losing patience)

      Will you ask your master if he wants to join the Knights

      of Camelot?!



                              FIRST SOLDIER

      But then of course African swallows are non-migratory.



                              SECOND SOLDIER

      Oh yes.



  ARTHUR raises his eyes heavenwards and nods to PATSY.  They turn

  and go off into the mist.



                              FIRST SOLDIER

      So they wouldn't be able to bring a coconut back anyway.



                              SECOND SOLDIER



      Wait a minute! Suppose two swallows carried it together?



                              FIRST SOLDIER

      No, they'd have to have it on a line.



  Stillness.  Silence again.





2  ANIMATION/LIVE ACTION SEQUENCE - DEATH AND DEVASTATION



  CUT TO Terry Gilliam's sequence of Brueghel prints.  Sounds of

  strange medieval music.  Discordant and sparse.  Wailings and

  groanings.  The last picture mixes through into live action.

  BIG CLOSE UP of contorted face upside down.  A leg falls across

  it.  Creaking noise.  The bodies lurch away from CAMERA to

  reveal they are amongst a huge pile of bodies on a swaying cart

  that is lumbering away from CAMERA.  It is pulled by a couple of

  ragged, dirty emaciated WRETCHES.  Behind the cart walks another

  MAN who looks slightly more prosperous, but only on the scale

  of complete and utter impoverishment.  He wears a black hood and

  looks sinister.



                              CART DRIVER

      Bring out your dead!



  We follow the cart through a wretched, impoverished plague-ridden

  village.  A few starved mongrels run about in the mud scavenging.

  In the open doorway of one house perhaps we jug glimpse a pair of

  legs dangling from the ceiling.  In another doorway an OLD WOMAN

  is beating a cat against a wall rather like one does with a mat.

  The cart passes round a dead donkey or cow in the mud.  And a MAN

  tied to a cart is being hammered to death by four NUNS with

  huge mallets.



                              CART DRIVER



      Bring out your dead!



  There are legs stick out of windows and doors.  Two MEN are fighting

  in the mud - covered from head to foot in it.  Another MAN is on his

  hands in knees shovelling mud into his mouth.  We just catch

  sight of a MAN falling into a well.



                              CART DRIVER

      Bring out your dead!



                              LARGE MAN

      Here's one!



                              CART DRIVER

      Ninepence.



                              BODY

      I'm not dead!



                              CART DRIVER

      What?



                              LARGE MAN

      Nothing... There's your ninepence.



                              BODY

      I'm not dead!



                              CART DRIVER

      'Ere.  He says he's not dead.



                              LARGE MAN

      Yes he is.



                              BODY

      I'm not!



                              CART DRIVER

      He isn't.



                              LARGE MAN

      He will be soon. He's very ill.



                              BODY

      I'm getting better!



                              LARGE MAN

      You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.



                              CART DRIVER

      I can't take him like this.  It's against regulations.



                              BODY

      I don't want to go on the cart.



                              LARGE MAN

      Don't be such a baby.



                              CART DRIVER

      I can't take him.



                              BODY

      I feel fine.



                              LARGE MAN

      Do me a favour.



                              CART DRIVER

      I can't.



                              LARGE MAN

      Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't

      be long.



                              CART DRIVER

      I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine

      today.



                              LARGE MAN

      When's your next round?



                              CART DRIVER

      Thursday.



                              BODY

      I think I'll go for a walk.



                              LARGE MAN

      You're not fooling anyone you know.

          (to CART DRIVER)

      Isn't there anything you could do?



                              BODY

          (singing unrecognisably)

      I feel happy... I feel happy.



  The CART DRIVER looks at the LARGE MAN for a moment.  Then they both

  do a quick furtive look up and down the street.  The CART DRIVER

  very swiftly brings up a club and hits the OLD MAN. (Out of shot

  but the singing stops after a loud bonk noise.)



                              LARGE MAN

          (handing over the money at last)

      Thanks very much.



                              CART DRIVER

      That's all right.  See you on Thursday.



  They turn ... Suddenly all the village fall to their knees, touching

  forelocks etc.  ARTHUR and PATSY ride into SHOT, slightly nose to

  the air, they ride through without acknowledging anybody.  After

  they pass, the LARGE MAN turns to the CART DRIVER.



                              LARGE MAN

      Who's that then?



                              CART DRIVER

          (Grudgingly)

      I dunno, Must be a king.



                              LARGE MAN

      Why?



                              CART DRIVER

      He hasn't got shit all over him.





3  EXTERIOR - DAY



  ARTHUR and PATSY riding.  They stop and look.  We see a castle in the

  distance, and before it a PEASANT is working away on his knees trying

  to dig up the earth with his bare hands and a twig.  ARTHUR and

  PATSY ride up, and stop before the PEASANT



                              ARTHUR

      Old woman!



                              DENNIS

      Man!



                              ARTHUR

      Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle

      over there?



                              DENNIS

      I'm thirty-seven.



                              ARTHUR

      What?



                              DENNIS:

      I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.



                              ARTHUR:

      Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'



                              DENNIS

      Well you could say: "Dennis"



                              ARTHUR

      I didn't know you were called Dennis.



                              DENNIS

      You didn't bother to find out, did you?



                              ARTHUR

      I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind

      you looked ...



                              DENNIS

      What I object to is that you automatically treat me like

      an inferior ...



                              ARTHUR

      Well ... I AM king.



                              DENNIS

      Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine

      clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that?

      By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist

      dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our

      society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...



  An OLD WOMAN appears.



                              OLD WOMAN

      Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh!

      how d'you do?



                              ARTHUR

      How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ...

      can you tell me who lives in that castle?



                              OLD WOMAN

      King of the WHO?



                              ARTHUR

      The Britons.



                              OLD WOMAN

      Who are the Britons?



                              ARTHUR

      All of us are ... we are all Britons.



  DENNIS winks at the OLD WOMAN.



      ... and I am your king ....



                              OLD WOMAN

      Ooooh!  I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were

      an autonomous collective ...



                              DENNIS

      You're fooling yourself.  We're living in a dictatorship,

      A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes ...



                              OLD WOMAN

      There you are, bringing class into it again ...



                              DENNIS

      That's what it's all about ...  If only -



                              ARTHUR

      Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in

      that castle?



                              OLD WOMAN

      No one live there.



                              ARTHUR

      Well, who is your lord?



                              OLD WOMAN

      We don't have a lord.



                              ARTHUR

      What?



                              DENNIS

      I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take

      it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.



                              ARTHUR

      Yes.



                              DENNIS

      ... But all the decision of that officer ...



                              ARTHUR

      Yes, I see.



                              DENNIS

      ... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority

      in the case of purely internal affairs.



                              ARTHUR

      Be quiet!



                              DENNIS

      ... but a two-thirds majority ...



                              ARTHUR

      Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.



                              OLD WOMAN

      Order, eh -- who does he think he is?



                              ARTHUR

      I am your king!



                              OLD WOMAN

      Well, I didn't vote for you.



                              ARTHUR

      You don't vote for kings.



                              OLD WOMAN

      Well, how did you become king, then?



                              ARTHUR

      The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,

      held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by

      Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ...

      That is why I am your king!

|

|                              OLD WOMAN

|      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one.

|

                              DENNIS

      Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out

      swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme

      executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from

      some farcical aquatic ceremony.



                              ARTHUR

      Be quiet!



                              DENNIS

      You can't expect to wield supreme executive power

      just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!



                              ARTHUR

      Shut up!



                              DENNIS

      I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some

      moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would

      put me away!



                              ARTHUR

          (Grabbing him by the collar)

      Shut up, will you. Shut up!



                              DENNIS

      Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.



                              ARTHUR

      Shut up!



  PEOPLE (i.e. other PEASANTS) are appearing and watching.



                              DENNIS

          (calling)

      Come and see the violence inherent in the system.

      Help, help, I'm being repressed!



                              ARTHUR

          (aware that people are now coming out and watching)

      Bloody peasant!

          (pushes DENNIS over into mud and prepares to ride off)



                              DENNIS

      Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.



                              ARTHUR

      Come on, patsy.



  They ride off.



                              DENNIS

          (in the background as we PULL OUT)

      did you see him repressing me, then?  That's what I've

      been on about ...





4  EXTERIOR - FOREST - DAY



  MIX THROUGH to ARTHUR and PATSY riding through the forest.  They pass rune

  stones.  We TRACK with them.  CLOSE-UPS of their faces as they ride.

  MIX to another TRACKING SHOT of them riding through the forest.  They

  come to a clearing and stop, looking ahead intently. Their eyes light up.



  Sound FX of fight.



  CUT TO their eyeline.  A clearing on the other side of which is a rough

  wooden foot-bridge across a stream.   At the start of the bridge a

  tremendous fight is going on.  A huge BLACK KNIGHT in black armour, his

  face totally masked in a visor, is fighting a slightly smaller KNIGHT in

  green armour.  (Perhaps the GREEN KNIGHT's armour is identical to the

  BLACK KNIGHT's save for the colour.)



  CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY.  They watch, growing more impressed

  as they watch the fight.



  CUT BACK TO the fight.  The GREEN KNIGHT lunges at the BLACK KNIGHT, who

  avoids the blow with a skillful side-step and parry, knocking the sword

  out of the GREEN KNIGHT's hand.



  CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY even more impressed.



  CUT BACK TO the fight.  The GREEN KNIGHT has drawn out a particularly nasty

  mace or spiked ball and chain, much longer than the BLACK KNIGHT's sword.



  ARTHUR narrows his eyes, wondering whether the BLACK KNIGHT will survive.



  CUT BACK to the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT swings at the BLACK KNIGHT, who

  ducks
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 10463 --]
 under the first swing, leaps over the second and starts to close

  on the GREEN KNIGHT.



  CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY watching like a tennis match. Sound FX of the

  fight reaching a climax.  Four almighty clangs.  Then Silence.



  CUT BACK to see the GREEN KNIGHT stretched out.  The BLACK KNIGHT

  sheathes his sword.



  ARTHUR looks at PATSY.  Nods and they move forward.



  CUT BACK TO the BLACK KNIGHT picking up the GREEN KNIGHT above his head

  and hurling him into the river.  ARTHUR and PATSY approach him.



                              ARTHUR

      You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.



|                              BLACK KNIGHT

|      Who dares to challenge the Black Knight?

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      I do not challenge you.



  The BLACK KNIGHT stares impassively and says nothing.



                              ARTHUR

      I am Arthur, King of the Britons.



  Hint of a pause as he waits for a reaction which dosn't come. ARTHUR is

  only slightly thrown.



      ... I seek the bravest and the finest knights in all

      the world to join me in my court at Camelot ...



  The BLACK KNIGHT remains silent



                              ARTHUR

      You have proved yourself worthy. ... Will you join me?



  Silence.



|                              ARTHUR

|      A man of your strength and skill would be the chief of all

|      my knights ...

|

|                              BLACK KNIGHT

|      Never.

|

                              ARTHUR

      You make me sad.  But so be it.  Come Patsy.



  As he moves, the BLACK KNIGHT bars the way.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      None shall pass.



                              ARTHUR

      What?



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      None shall pass.



                              ARTHUR

      I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must

      cross this bridge.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      Then you shall die.



                              ARTHUR

      I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      I move for no man.



                              ARTHUR

      So be it!



  ARTHUR draws his sword and approaches the BLACK KNIGHT.  A furious fight

  now starts lasting about fifteen seconds at which point ARTHUR delivers

  a mighty blow which completely severs the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm at

  the shoulder.  ARTHUR steps back triumphantly.



                              ARTHUR

      Now stand aside worthy adversary.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

          (Glancing at his shoulder)

      'Tis but a scratch.



                              ARTHUR

      A scratch?  Your arm's off.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      No, it isn't.



                              ARTHUR

          (Pointing to the arm on ground)

      Well, what's that then?



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      I've had worse.



                              ARTHUR

      You're a liar.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      Come on you pansy!



  Another ten seconds furious fighting till ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHTS's

  other arm off, also at the shoulder.  The arm plus sword, lies on the ground.

                              ARTHUR

      Victory is mine.

          (sinking to his knees)

      I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      Come on then.



                              ARTHUR

      What?



  He kicks ARTHUR hard on the side of the helmet.  ARTHUR gets up still

  holding his sword.  The BLACK KNIGHT comes after him kicking.



                              ARTHUR

      You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      Had enough?



                              ARTHUR

      You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      Course I have.



                              ARTHUR

      Look!



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      What!  Just a flesh wound.

          (kicks ARTHUR)



                              ARTHUR

      Stop that.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

          (kicking him)

      Had enough ... ?



                              ARTHUR

      I'll have your leg.



  He is kicked.



      Right!



  The BLACK KNIGHT kicks him again and ARTHUR chops his leg off.

  The BLACK KNIGHT keeps his balance with difficulty.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      I'll do you for that.



                              ARTHUR

      You'll what ... ?



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      Come Here.



                              ARTHUR

      What are you going to do. bleed on me?



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      I'm invincible!



                              ARTHUR

      You're a looney.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!



  ARTHUR takes his last leg off.  The BLACK KNIGHT's body lands upright.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      All right, we'll call it a draw.



                              ARTHUR

      Come, Patsy.



  ARTHUR and PATSY start to cross the bridge.



                              BLACK KNIGHT

      Running away eh?  You yellow bastard, Come back here and take

      what's coming to you.  I'll bite your legs off!





5  EXTERIOR - DAY



  A village.  Sound of chanting of Latin canon, punctuated by short, sharp

  cracks.  It comes nearer.  We see it is a line of MONKS ala SEVENTH SEAL

  flagellation scene, chanting and banging themselves on the foreheads with

  wooden boards.  They pass a group of villagers who are dragging a beautiful

  YOUNG WOMAN dressed as a witch through the streets.  They drag her to a

  strange house/ruin standing on a hill outside the village.  A

  strange-looking knight stands outside, SIR BEDEVERE.



                              FIRST VILLAGER

      We have found a witch.  May we burn her?



                              ALL

      A Witch! Burn her!



                              BEDEVERE

      How do you know she is a witch?



                              ALL

      She looks like one. Yes, she does.



                              BEDEVERE

      Bring her forward.



  They bring her forward - a beautiful YOUNG GIRL (MISS ISLINGTON) dressed up

  as a witch.



                              WITCH

      I am not a witch.  I am not a witch.



                              BEDEVERE

      But you are dressed as one.



                              WITCH

      They dressed me up like this.



                              ALL

      We didn't, we didn't!



                              WITCH

      This is not my nose,  It is a false one.



  BEDEVERE takes her nose off.



                              BEDEVERE

      Well?



                              FIRST VILLAGER

      ... Well, we did do the nose.



                              BEDEVERE

      The nose?



                              FIRST VILLAGER

      And the hat.  But she is a witch.



                              ALL

      A witch,  a witch,  burn her!



                              BEDEVERE

      Did you dress her up like this?



                              FIRST VILLAGER

      ... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.



                              BEDEVERE

      Why do you think she is a witch?



                              SECOND VILLAGER

      She turned me into a newt.



                              BEDEVERE

      A newt?



                              SECOND VILLAGER

          (After looking at himself for some time)

      I got better.



                              ALL

      Burn her anyway.



                              BEDEVERE

      Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.



  ARTHUR and PATSY ride up at this point and watch what follows with interest



                              ALL

      There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?



                              BEDEVERE

      Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?



                              ALL

      Burn them.



                              BEDEVERE

      And what do you burn, apart from witches?



                              FOURTH VILLAGER

      ... Wood?



                              BEDEVERE

      So why do witches burn?



                              SECOND VILLAGER

          (pianissimo)

      ... Because they're made of wood...?



                              BEDEVERE

      Good.



  PEASANTS stir uneasily then come round to this conclusion.



                              ALL

      I see.  Yes, of course.



                              BEDEVERE

      So how can we tell if she is made of wood?



                              FIRST VILLAGER

      Make a bridge out of her.



                              BEDEVERE

      Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?



                              ALL

      Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...



                              BEDEVERE

      Does wood sink in water?



                              ALL

      No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To

      the pond.



                             BEDEVERE

      Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?



                              ALL

      Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...



                              ARTHUR

      A duck.



  They all turn and look at ARTHUR.  BEDEVERE looks up very impressed.



                              BEDEVERE

      Exactly.  So... logically ...



                              FIRST VILLAGER

          (beginning to pick up the thread)

      If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.



                              BEDEVERE

      And therefore?



                              ALL

      A witch! ... A duck!  A duck!  Fetch a duck.



                              FOURTH VILLAGER

      Here is a duck, Sir Bedevere.



                              BEDEVERE

      We shall use my largest scales.



  He leads them a few yards 
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 5921 --]
to a very strange contraption indeed,  made of

  wood and rope and leather.  They put the GIRL in one pan and the duck

  in another.  Each pan is supported by a wooden stave.  BEDEVERE checks

  each pan then ... ARTHUR looks on with interest.



                              BEDEVERE

      Remove the supports.



  Two PEASANTS knock them away with sledge hammers.  The GIRL and the duck

  swing slightly but balance perfectly.



                              ALL

      A witch!  A witch!



                              WITCH

      It's a fair cop.



                              All

      Burn her!  Burn her!  Let's make her into a ladder.



  The VILLAGERS drag the girl away, leaving ARTHUR and BEDEVERE regarding

  each other admiringly.



                              BEDEVERE

      Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?



                              ARTHUR

      I am Arthur, King of the Britons.



                              BEDEVERE

      My liege ... forgive me ...



  ARTHUR looks at PATSY with obvious satisfaction.





                              ARTHUR

      Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot,

      and join our number at the Round Table?



                              BEDEVERE

      My liege,  I am honored.



  ARTHUR steps forward, drawing his sword, with a slight hint of difficulty



                              ARTHUR

      What is your name?



                              BEDEVERE

      Bedevere, my Liege.



                              ARTHUR

      Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!

|                               VOICE OVER

|       And so King Arthur gathered his knights together ... bringing from all

|       the corners of the kingdom the strongest and bravest in the land ...

|       To sit at The Round Table ...

|

|   Under this voice over we have a montage of shots of ARTHUR recruiting

|   his Knights:

|

|   1.   ARTHUR, PATSY, BEDEVERE and PAGE riding through hillside.

|        MIX TO:

|

|   2.   A castle.  LONG SHOT of SIR GAWAIN standing outside and ARTHUR's

|        group approaching and shaking hands perhaps.

|

|   3.   MIX TO the group now plus SIR GAWAIN and PAGE (who is weighted

|        down by an enormous quantity of luggage) riding down by a stream

|        and approaching SIR HECTOR.  ARTHUR dubs him.

|

|   4.   MIX TO the group (now plus HECTOR and PAGE) approaching some group

|        of buildings or whatever.  In the distance SIR ROBIN is being taught

|        the lute by one of his MUSICIANS.  ARTHUR calls and SIR ROBIN

|        immediately reacts and hands the lute to his MUSICIAN and comes to

|        join ARTHUR & CO.

|

|   5.   MIX TO SIR GALAHAD surrounded by chickens.  He is wearing a carpenters

|        apron over his immaculate armour and is finishing off a hen-house.

|        We see the group approach and he throws off the apron and puts down

|        the hen-house and goes to join them.

|

|   6.   MIX TO the group riding along again.

|

|   7.   MIX TO SIR LAUNCELOT handing a BABY to his WIFE (who has several other

|        CHILDREN hanging about) and he strides off to join ARTHUR, leaving his

|        castle, WIFE and CHILDREN.  The castle (Eilean Donan) has washing

|        hanging outside it.  A real family castle.  There are at least

|        six kids.

|

|   8.   MIX TO the complete group, i.e. ARTHUR and PATSY, BEDEVERE and PAGE,

|        GAWAIN and PAGE, HECTOR and PAGE, GALAHAD and PAGE, SIR ROBIN and

|        six MUSICIANS, LAUNCELOT and PAGE.

7  EXTERIOR - SUNSET



  Fairly close HEAD-ON SHOT of the KNIGHTS riding along. BEDEVERE and ARTHUR

  at the front of the group deep in conversation.



                              BEDEVERE

      And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.



                              ARTHUR

      This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how

      sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.



                              BEDEVERE

      OF course, my Liege ...



                              LAUNCELOT

          (he points)

      Look, my liege!



  They all stop and look.



                              ARTHUR

          (with thankful reverence)

      Camelot!



  CUT TO shot of amazing castle in the di

  CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and the group.  They are all staring with fascination.

      Camelot ...



                              LAUNCELOT

          (turning sharply)

      Sh!

          (to the rest)

      Knights!  I bid you welcome to your new home!  Let us ride ...

      to Camelot.





8  INTERIOR - NIGHT



  CUT TO interior of medieval hall.  A large group of armoured KNIGHTS are

  engaged in a well choreographed song-and-dance routine of the very up-beat

  'If they could see me now' type of fast bouncy number.  The poorer verses

  are made clearer by CUTTING to a group of knights actually engaged in

  the described task while the line itself is sung.  They sing:



                              KNIGHTS

      We're knights of the round table

      We dance whene'er we're able

      We do routines and chorus scenes

      With footwork impeccable.

      We dine well here in Camelot

      We eat ham and jam and spam a lot.



      We're knights of the Round Table

      Our shows are formidable

      But many times

      We're given rhymes

      That are quite unsingable

      We're opera mad in Camelot

      We sing from the diaphragm a lot.



  Booming basses.  A routine where two XYLOPHONISTS play parts of KNIGHTS'

  armour producing a pleasing effect.



      In war we're tough and able.

      Quite indefatigable

      Between our quests

      We sequin vests

      And impersonate Clark Gable

      It's a busy life in Camelot.



                              SINGLE MAN

      I have to push the pram a lot.



  CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and COMPANY as we had left them.



                              ARTHUR

      No, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.



                              KNIGHTS

      Right!



                              ARTHUR

      It is a silly place.



  They set off again almost immediately they are suffused in ethereal radiance

  and strange heavenly choir music.  The PAGES, horselike, take fright for a

  moment, they whinny and rattle their coconuts.  ARTHUR and the KNIGHTS

  fall on their knees.  A holy voice booms out.



                              GOD

      Arthur!  Arthur ...  King of the Britons ...



  They all prostrate themselves even further



      Oh, don't grovel ... do get up!  If there's one thing I can't stand,

      it's people grovelling!!



  ARTHUR and COMPANY rise.



                              ARTHUR

      Sorry ...



                              GOD

      And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's

      sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ...

      What are you doing now?



                              ARTHUR

      I'm averting my eyes, Lord.



                              GOD

      Well, don't.

|      I really don't know where all this got started.

      It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing.

      Now knock it of



                              ARTHUR

      Yes, Lord.



                              GOD

      Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round

      Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...



                              ARTHUR

      Good idea, O Lord!



                              GOD

      Course it's a good idea.



  Suddenly another light glows beside GOD or possibly within the light which

  is GOD a shape slowly starts to form.



      Behold ... Arthur ... this is the Holy Grail ...

|      the Sacred Cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper ...



  The form in the bright light is just discernible as an iridescent chalice

  ... the KNIGHTS gasp.



      Look well, Arthur ... for it is your sacred task to seek

      this Grail.



  It begins to fade.  Music crescendo as both lights fade.



      That is your purpose Arthur ... the Quest for the Holy Grail ...



  It is gone.  All the KNIGHTS are left gasping in awe and wonderment.  They

  all turn and look at ARTHUR.



                             LAUNCELOT

      A Blessing.  A blessing from the lord.



|                             BEDEVERE

|      Praise be to God!

|

|  An awed pause, then ARTHUR rallies them.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      We have a task,  we must waste no time! To Camelot!

|

+                              GALAHAD

+      God be praised!



  Stirring music crescendo.  They ride off.

9  EXTERIOR - CASTLE - DAY



  MIX THROUGH one or two shots of them on their way again, until they approach

  a terrific castle (a little one would do too).  They advance quite close to

  the castle and draw themselves into a line.  At a signal from ARTHUR the two

  PAGES step forward and give a brief fanfare.



  A MAN appears on the battlements.  ARTHUR addresses him.



                              ARTHUR

      Hello.



                              MAN

      'Allo.  Whoo is eet?



                              ARTHUR

      I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round

      Table.  Whose castle is this?



                              MAN

      This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.



                              ARTHUR

      Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God

      with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for

      this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.



                              MAN

      Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.

      He's already got one, you see?



                              ARTHUR

      What?



                              GALAHAD

      He says they've already got one!



  They are stunned.



                              ARTHUR

      Are you sure he's got one?



                              MAN

      Oh yes.  It's very nice

+

+  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER (MAN) turns to some others.

+

+                              MAN

+      I told him we already got one.

+

+  They all giggle.

+



                             ARTHUR

      Well ... can we come up and have a look?



                              MAN

      Of course not!  You are English pigs.



                              ARTHUR

      Well, what are you then?



                              MAN

      I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you

      silly king.



                              GALAHAD

      What are you doing in England?



                              MAN

      Mind your own business.



                              ARTHUR

      If you will not show us the Grail we shall storm your castle.



  Murmurs of assent.



                              MAN

      You don't frighten us, English pig-dog!  Go and boil your

      bottoms, son of a silly person.  I blow my nose on you, so-called

      Arthur-king, you and your silly English K...kaniggets.



  He puts hands to his ears and blows a raspberry.



                              GALAHAD

      What a strange person.



                              ARTHUR

      Now look here, my good man!



                              MAN

      I don't want to talk to you, no more, you empty-headed animal,

      food trough wiper.  I fart in your general direction.  You mother

      was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.



                              GALAHAD

      Is there someone else up there we could talk to?



                              MAN

      No.  Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time.



                              ARTHUR

      Now this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonab...

  CUT BACK TO battlements.  A cow is led out of a stall.



  CUT BACK TO ARTHUR.



                              ARTHUR

      Now that is my final offer.  If you are not prepared to agree to my

      demands I shall be forced to take ... Oh Christ!



  A cow comes flying over the battlements,  lowing aggressively.  The cow

  lands on GALAHAD'S PAGE, squashing him completely.

|

|                              ROBIN

|      What a cruel thing to do.

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|          (Choking back tears)

|      It hadn't even been milked.

|

                              ARTHUR

      Right! Knights! Forward!



  ARTHUR leads a charge toward the castle.  Various shots of them battling on,

  despite being hit by a variety of farm animals.



                              ARTHUR

          (as the MAN next to him is squashed by a sheep)

      Knights!  Run away!



  Midst echoing shouts of "run away" the KNIGHTS retreat to cover with the odd

  cow or goose hitting them still.  The KNIGHTS crouch down under cover.



                              LAUNCELOT

      The sods!  I'll tear them apart.



                              ARTHUR

          (restraining LAUNCELOT from going out and having a go)

      No!



                              BEDEVERE

      I have a plan sir.



  CUT BACK TO battlements of castle.  FRENCH SENTRIES suspiciously peering

  towards the English lines.  Wind whistles.



  Shot of the empty scrubland or undergrowth or woodland around the castle.

  Emptiness.  Wind.  More shots of the FRENCH SENTRIES peering into the dusk.

|  As night falls.  MIX THROUGH TO night On the battlements a brazier burns or

|  torches on the wall as the SENTRIES peer into the dark. Shots of the

|  woodland with fires burning where the English lines are.



  During all this the sounds of extensive carpentry have possibly been herd,

  followed by silence, followed by renewed outbursts or activity.



  CLOSE-UP FRENCH looking very nervous.  Dawn breaking. Shot of woodland.

  Nothing.  Wind.  Dawn still breaking.  Shots of the FRENCH.  They suddenly

  hear something.  A faintly detectable squeaking which is getting louder.



  CUT TO WIDE SHOT of castle and woodland.  Squeaking getting louder.  Shot of

  the FRENCH TAUNTER pointing.  WIDE SHOT again.  The squeaking gets louder

  an enormous twenty-foot-high wooden rabbit is wheeled out of the

  undergrowth into the open space in front of the castle.  The ENGLISH scuttle

  back into the undergrowth.  The rabbit has a large red bow tied round it

  and a rather crudely written label,  which reads "Pour votres amis

  Francais". The CHIEF TAUNTER looks at it, narrowing his eyes.  Then he

  turns and leaves battlements.



  CUT TO ARTHUR and COMPANY watching from the bushes.  The main gate of the

  castle opens a little and the CHIEF TAUNTER's head sticks out,  then another

  Froggie head,  then another.  They mutter to each other in French,  look

  rather pleased,  then rush out and start to pull the giant rabbit in.



  CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and COMPANY behind some bushes watching.



                              ARTHUR

      Now what happens?



                              BEDEVERE

      Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall

      and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise,

      not only by surprise but totally unarmed!



                              ARTHUR

      Who ... Who breaks out?



                              BEDEVERE

      Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the

      rabbit and ...



  LAUNCELOT covers his eyes.



                              BEDEVERE

      Look, if we were to build a large wooden badger...



  ARTHUR cuffs him.  ARTHUR looks at the battlements.  There is a loud twang.

  Look of horror.  The rabbit comes sailing over the battlements.





                              ARTHUR

      Run away!



  More shouts.



      Run away!



|                              SIR GAWAIN

|          (to his PAGE as they run away)

|      It's only a model.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Sh!



  They continue to retreat.  The rabbit lands on GAWAIN'S PAGE

  (who is already weighed down by enormous quantity of luggage).





10  EXTERIOR - CASTLE WALLS - DAY



   CUT TO a MAN in modern dress standing outside a castle.  He speaks straight

   to CAMERA in a documentary kind of way.



   SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:  A Very Famous Historian.



                              HISTORIAN'S SPEECH

      Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened

      King Arthur ... The ferocity of the French taunting took him

      completely by surprise and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy

      was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought

      to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest

      knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail

      individually.  Now, this is what they did.  No sooner...



   A KNIGHT rides into shot and hacks him to the ground.  He rides off.



   We stay for a moment on the glade.  A MIDDLE-AGED LADY in a C. & A.

   twin-set emerges from the trees and looks in horror at the body of her

   HUSBAND.



                              MRS HISTORIAN

      FRANK!



   CUT TO animated frame,  with the words "The Tale of Sir Robin" on it.

   Pleasant pastoral music.  MIX THROUGH TO:

+   VOICE: "The Tale Of Sir Robin"





11  EXTERIOR - GLADE - DAY



   A KNIGHT is trotting along through a wooden sun-dapled glade, followed by

   his trusty PAGE banging the usual half coconuts.  As we see them approach

   we hear the beautiful lilting sound of medieval music, and see that

   the KNIGHT is followed by a small retinue of MUSICIANS in

   thirteenth-century courtly costume, one sings, and plays the tambourine,

   one bangs at a tabor (A small drum O.E.D) and one plays the pipes.



   The KNIGHT looks very proud and firm as we hear the first part of the song,

   but the combination of the lyrics and the large signs they pass, start

   to have their effect ...



   SONG:



      Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot,

      He was not afraid to die, Oh Brave Sir Robin,

      He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways

      Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin.



      He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp

      Or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken;

      To have his kneecaps split and his body burned away

      And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin.



      His head smashed in,  and his heart cut out,

      And his liver removed, and his bowels unplugged,

      And his nostrils raped, and his bottom burned off,

      And his penis split ... and his ...



                              ROBIN

      Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads.

      It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.



                              SINGERS

      Brave, Sir Rob ...



                              ROBIN

      Shut up.



  They have ridden past the following signs, all in triplicate:-



      +------------------------------------------------------+

      | CAMELOT 43                         CERTAIN DEATH I   |

   +------------------------------------------------------------+





12 EXTERIOR - GLADE - DAY



  They now pass three KNIGHTS impaled to a tree.  With their feet off the

  ground,  with one lance through the lot of them, they are skewered up

  like a barbecue.



  Then they pass three KNIGHTS sitting on the ground with one enormous axe

[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 1911 --]

  through their skulls.  They look timorous.



|  Then a huge tree is absolutely packed with MAIDENS tied to it.  They all

|  look fed up.  SIR ROBIN calls out cheerfully as he passes.

|

|                              ROBIN

|      Morning.

|

|                              ONE LADY

|      Bye.

|

  SIR ROBIN rides on a little way with the music building up enormous and

  terrifying tension, until suddenly there standing before him is an

  enormous THREE-HEADED KNIGHT.



                              THREE HEADS

      Halt!  Who art thou?



                              SINGERS

      He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...



                              ROBIN

          (to SINGERS)

      Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.



                              THREE HEADS

      What do you want?



                              SINGERS

      To fight and ...



                              ROBIN

      Shut up.  Nothing really.  just to pass through, good Sir knight.



                              THREE HEADS

      I'm afraid not.

|      This is my bit of the forest.  Find your own bit.



                              ROBIN

      I am a Knight of King Arthur's Round Table.

|      I seek the Holy Grail - Stand aside and let me pass.



                              THREE HEADS

      You are a Knight of the Round Table?



                              ROBIN

      I am.



  From now on the THREE HEADS speak individually.



                              SECOND HEAD

      Shit.



                              FIRST HEAD

      In that case I shall have to kill you.



                              SECOND HEAD

      Shall I?



                              THIRD HEAD

      Oh, I don't think so.



                              SECOND HEAD

      I'm not sure.



                              MIDDLE HEAD

          (to FIRST)

   
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 11577 --]
   What do I think?



                              LEFT HEAD

      I think kill him.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      I'm still not sure.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      All right.  How many of me think I should kill him?

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      I do.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      One.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      That's not a quorum.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      It is if I'm the Chairman.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      Oo, it's not.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      I'm the Chairman this week.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      You're not.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      Look, it'll make it much simpler if I vote with me.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      To kill him.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      Yeah.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|          (tuts)

|      Oh, damn.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|         (to SIR ROBIN)

|      Knight, I have decided to kill you.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      With one absenting.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      Knight, I have decided to kill you with one absenting.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|          (to SIR ROBIN)

|      Sorry about this but I have to be fair.

|

|                              ROBIN

|      Oh, that's all right.  So you are going to kill me with your big axe.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      Er no, with my sword.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      Dagger.

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      Mace is quicker.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      No, no, the sword, it's easier.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      He said axe.

|

|                              ROBIN

|      Look, hurry up six eyes, or I shall cut your head off.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|          (to SIR ROBIN, referring to FIRST HEAD)

|      For God's sake, CUT that one off, and do us all a favour.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      What do you mean?

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      Yapping on all the time.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      You're lucky, you're not next to him.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      What do you mean?

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      You snore.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      Oo, lies.  Anyway, you've got bad breath.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|          (aspirating heavily)

|      I haven't.

|

|  Both THIRD and FIRST HEADS turn away slightly, making faces.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      It's not my fault.  It's what you both eat.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      Look, stop this bitching.  We've got a knight to kill.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      He's buggered off.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      So he has.  He's scarpered.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      That's all your fault.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      No, it's not.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|          (swipes at himself)

|      Take that.

|

|                              SECOND HEAD

|      Ow.

|

|                              FIRST HEAD

|      I'm sorry.

|

|                              THIRD HEAD

|      'Ere, stop it.  I'll teach you.

|

|  The BODY starts laying into itself with sword and mace, while the HEADS

|  argue and shout with pain.  We PAN gently across to the MAIDENS on their

|  tree.  They are still very fed up.

|

|                              MAIDEN

|      I suppose we're lucky he's only got three heads.

|

|                              LOVELY

|      Chance would be a fine thing.

+

+                              THIRD HEAD

+      Oh! let's be nice to him.

+

+                              FIRST HEAD

+      Oh shut up.

+

+                              ROBIN

+      Perhaps I could ...

+

+                              FIRST HEAD

+      Oh! quick! get the sword out I want to cut his head off.

+

+                              THIRD HEAD

+      Oh, cut your own head off.

+

+                              SECOND HEAD

+      Yes - do us all a favour.

+

+                              FIRST HEAD

+      What?

+

+                              THIRD HEAD

+      Yapping on all the time.

+

+                              SECOND HEAD

+      You're lucky, you're not next to him.

+

+                              THIRD HEAD

+      What do you mean?

+

+                              SECOND HEAD

+      You snore.

+

+                              THIRD HEAD

+      Ooh, lies! anyway you've got bad breath.

+

+                              SECOND HEAD

+      Well only because you don't brush my teeth ...

+

+                              THIRD HEAD

+      Oh! stop bickering and let's go and have tea and biscuits.

+

+                              FIRST HEAD

+      All right! All right! We'll kill him first and then have tea

+      and biscuits.

+

+                              SECOND HEAD

+      Yes.

+

+                              THIRD HEAD

+      Oh! not biscuits ...

+

+                              FIRST HEAD

+      All right! All right! not biscuits - but lets kill him anyway ...

+

+  WIDE-SHOT THE 3-HEADED KNIGHT is alone.

+

+                              SECOND HEAD

+      He's buggered off!

+

+                              THIRD HEAD

+      So he has! He's scarpered.





13 EXTERIOR - GLADE - DAY



  Quick sequence of SIR ROBIN.  The music is jolly and bright, as if

  triumphant.  ROBIN is not at all happy with the lyrics.



                              SINGERS

      Brave Sir Robin ran away.



                              ROBIN

      I didn't.



                              SINGERS

      Bravely ran away, away.



                              ROBIN

      No, no, no.



                              SINGERS

      When danger reared its ugly head,

      He bravely turned his tail and fled

      Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about

      And gallantly he chickened out

      Bravely taking to his feet

      He beat a very brave retreat

      Bravest of the brave Sir Robin

      Petrified of being dead

      Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin

      Turned away and fled.



  They disappear into distance.



  ANIMATION:  "The Tale Of Sir Galahad"





14 EXTERIOR - STORM - FOREST - DUSK



  As the storm rages we pick up GALAHAD forcing his way through brambles and

  over slippery rocks.  Progress is hard.  He pauses and at this moment

  we hear the howling of wolves.  GALAHAD turns, then hurries onward even

  more urgently.  Another louder, closer howl is herd and GALAHAD stumbles

  and falls heavily.  Though obviously injured he bravely struggles

  forward a little and regains his feed reacting with pain.  More louder

  closer howling.  He grips his sword valiantly and as he glances around

  a flash of lightning reveals the silhouette of a huge terrifying castle,

  perhaps looking rather derelict.  He makes up his mind in an instant and

  stumbles manfully toward it.  More louder howling.  He reaches the

  forbidding and enormous doors of the castle and beats on the doors with the

  handle of his sword, looking over his shoulder the while.  Pause.

  He beats again, shouting:



                              GALAHAD

      Open.  Open the doors.  In the name of King Arthur.  Open the doors.

|      I am Sir Galahad, a knight of the Round Table.

|

|  Some suitable noises are herd inside.

|

|      I am on a quest for the Holy Grail.  I seek shelter.



  Some rattling chainy noises come from inside with huge bolts being

  drawn.  The wolves' howling is very close.  As the door creaks

  open GALAHAD steps quickly inside.



15 INTERIOR - CASTLE - NIGHT



  From inside we see GALAHAD enter, wiping the rain from his eyes, and turn

  as the door crashes behind him.  GALAHAD turns to the door reacting to the

  fact he is trapped.



                              ZOOT (OUT OF VISION)

      Hello!



  GALAHAD turns back.  We see from his POV the lovely ZOOT standing by him

  smiling enchantingly and a number of equally delectable GIRLIES draped

  around in the seductively poulticed room.  They look at him smilingly and

  wave.



                              GIRLIES

      Hello!



                              ZOOT

      Welcome, gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax.



                              GALAHAD

      The Castle Anthrax?



                              ZOOT

      Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are

      nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!



                              GALAHAD

      Er ...

+      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?



                              ZOOT

      The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget!

      Crapper!



                              MIDGET AND CRAPPER

      Yes, O Zoot?



                              ZOOT

      Prepare a bed for our guest.



                              MIDGET AND CRAPPER

          (grovelling with delight)

      Oh thank you, Zoot, thank you, thank you.



                              ZOOT

      Away varletesses!

          (to GALAHAD)

      The beds here are warm and soft and very, very big.



                              GALAHAD

      Well, look er, I ...



                              ZOOT

      What is your name, handsome knight?



                              GALAHAD

      Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.



                              ZOOT

      Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot

          (she is very close to him for a moment)

      But come.



  She turns away and leads him towards a door leading to a corner leading

  to the bedchamber



                              GALAHAD

      Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...



                              ZOOT

      Sir Galahad!!



  There is a gasp from the other GIRLS



                              ZOOT

      You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.



  GALAHAD looks at the other GIRLS.  They are clearly on the verge of

  being offended.



                              GALAHAD

      Well ...



                              ZOOT

          (she moves off and GALAHAD unwillingly follows)

      I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared

      to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between

      sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no

      one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ...

      dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....



  They reach the end of the corridor and enter the bedchamber.

  ZOOT turns



                              ZOOT

      We are just not used to handsome knights ...

          (she notices him limping)

      But you are wounded!



                              GALAHAD

      No, It's nothing!



                              ZOOT

      You must see the doctors immediately.

           (she claps again)

      You must lie down.



  She almost forces him to lie on the
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 8688 --]
 bed as PIGLET and WINSTON enter the

  room.  They are equally beautiful and dressed exotically.  They

  approach GALAHAD.



                              PIGLET

      Well,  what seems to be the trouble?



                              GALAHAD

      They're doctors?



                              ZOOT

      They have a basic medical training, yes.  Now you must try to rest.

      Dr. Winston! Dr. Piglet!  Practice your art!!



                              WINSTON

      Try to relax.



                              GALAHAD

      No look, really, this isn't nescess ...



                              PIGLET

      We must examine you.



                              GALAHAD

      There's nothing wrong with ... that.



                              PIGLET

          (slightly irritated)

      Please ... we are doctors.



  ZOOT reappears.  GALAHAD tries for one brief moment to relax.  Then there is

  a sharp boing from the lower part of his armour.  WINSTON glances quickly

  in the appropriate direction as GALAHAD sits up and starts getting off the

  bed and collecting his armour, saying:



                              GALAHAD

      No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!



                              PIGLET

      Back to your bed!  At once!



                              GALAHAD

      I'm sorry, I must go.



  GALAHAD hurries to the door and pushes through it.  As he leaves the room

  we CUT TO the reverse to show that he is now in a room full of bathing

  and romping GIRLIES, all innocent, wide-eyed and beautiful.  They smile

  enchantingly at him as he tries to keep walking without being diverted by

  the lovely sights assaulting his eyeballs.  He nods to them stiffly once

  or twice and then his eye catches a particularly stunning YOUNG LADY.

  He visibly gulps with repressed emotion and cannot resist saying:

|

|                              GALAHAD

|      Good evening ... Ah, Zoot!  Er ...

|

|                              DINGO

|      No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.

|

|                              GALAHAD

|      Oh.  Well, I'm sorry, but I must leave immediately.

|

|                              DINGO

|          (very dramatically)

|      No!  Oh, no!  Bad ... bad Zoot.

|

|                              GALAHAD

|      Er, why?

|

|                              DINGO

|      She has been lying again ... she told us you had promised to

|      stay for ever!

|

|                              GALAHAD

|      Oh!

+

+                              GALAHAD

+      Oh ... will you excuse me?

+

+                              DINGO

+      Where are you going?

+

+                              GALAHAD

+      I have seen the Grail! I have seen it - here in this castle!

+

+                              DINGO

+      No!  Oh, no!  Bad ... bad Zoot!

+

+                              GALAHAD

+      What is it?

+

+                              DINGO

+      Bad, wicked, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting fire to our beacon,

+      which - I have just remembered - is grail-shaped ...  It is not the

+      first time we've had this problem.

+

+                              GALAHAD

+      It's not the real Grail?

+

+                              DINGO

      Wicked wicked Zoot ... she is a bad person and she must pay the

      penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment

      ... you must tie her down on a bed ... and spank her.  Come!



                              GIRLS

      A spanking!  A spanking!



                              DINGO

      You must spank her well and after you have spanked her you

      may deal with her as you like and then ... spank me.



                              AMAZING

      And spank me!



                              STUNNER

      And me.



                              LOVELY

      And me.



                              DINGO

      Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!



                              GIRLS

      A spanking.  A spanking.  There is going to be a spanking tonight.



                              DINGO

      And after the spanking ... the oral sex.



                              GALAHAD

      Oh, dear! Well, I...



                              GIRLS

      The oral sex ...  The oral sex.



                              GALAHAD

      Well, I suppose I could stay a BIT longer.



  At this moment there is a commotion behind and SIR LAUNCELOT and CONCORD,

  possibly plus GAWAIN, burst into the bathing area with swords drawn and

  form themselves round SIR GALAHAD threatening the GIRLS.



                              LAUNCELOT

      Sir Galahad!



                              GALAHAD

      Oh ... hello ...



                              LAUNCELOT

      Quick!



                              GALAHAD

      Why?



                              LAUNCELOT

      You are in great peril.



                              DINGO

      No he isn't



                              LAUNCELOT

      Silence! Foul temptress!



                              GALAHAD

      Well, she's got a point.



                              LAUNCELOT

      We'll cover your escape!



                              GALAHAD

      Look - I'm fine!



                              GIRLS

      Sir Galahad!



  He threatens DINGO.



                              GALAHAD

      No. Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!



                              GIRLS

      Yes, yes, let him Tackle us single-handed!



                              LAUNCELOT

      Come Sir Galahad, quickly!



                              GALAHAD

      No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!



                              DINGO

      Yes, let him handle us easily.



                              LAUNCELOT

      No sir.  Quick!





  He starts pulling GALAHAD away.



                              GALAHAD

      No, please.  Please! I can defeat them!  There's only a hundred.



                              GIRLS

      He will beat us easily.  We haven't a chance.



                              DINGO

      Oh shit!



  By now LAUNCELOT and CONCORDE have hustled GALAHAD out of the bathing

  area and are running through the outside door.



                              LAUNCELOT

      We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.



                              GALAHAD

          (dragging his feet somewhat)

      I don't think I was.



                              LAUNCELOT

      You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.



                              GALAHAD

      Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?



                              LAUNCELOT

      It's too perilous.



  They are right outside the castle by now.



                              GALAHAD

      Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.



                              LAUNCELOT

      No, no, we must find the Grail.



 The thunderstorm is over.  A bunch (sic) of PAGES are tethered to a tree with

 more MEN waiting.  Their tethers are untied and the PAGES start banging away

 with their coconuts.  GALAHAD is swept along with them as they ride off.



                              GALAHAD

      Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?



                              LAUNCELOT

      No.  It's unhealthy.



                              GALAHAD

      ... I Bet you're gay.



                              LAUNCELOT

      No, I'm not.



  GAWAIN or CONCORDE gives a knowing glance at LAUNCELOT.  VOICE comes in as

  they ride off.



                              VOICE OVER

      Sir Launcelot had saved Galahad from almost certain

      temptation but they were still lost, far from the goal

      of their search for the Holy Grail.  Only Bedevere and

      King Arthur himself, riding day and night, had made

      any progress.





16  ANIMATION/LIVE ACTION



   ARTHUR and BEDEVERE in the depths of a dark forest with an old blind

   SOOTHSAYER.  He lies in a broken down old woodman's hut.



                              ARTHUR

      And this "Enchanter" of whom you speak,  he has seen the grail?



  The SOOTHSAYER laughs forbiddingly, adding to the general spookiness of

  this encounter.



                              ARTHUR

      Where does he live?

          (he stares into the blind eyes of the OLD MAN)

      Old man ... where does he live ...



                              SOOTHSAYER

      He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.



                              ARTHUR

[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 5792 --]

      And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?



  The BLIND MAN laughs again to himself.



                              SOOTHSAYER

      There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge

      of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.



                              ARTHUR

      But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?



                              SOOTHSAYER

      Seek you the Bridge of Death ...



                              ARTHUR

      The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?



  The OLD MAN laughs sinisterly and mockingly.  They look down and he is

  gone.  They stand up.  Suddenly behind them is a noise.  They turn sharply

  in the door of the little hut is a cat.  It miaows and is gone.  They

  slowly back out of the hut.  As they touch the doorposts they just flake

  away into dust.  The whole hut is rotten.  It collapses



  Spooky music.  They are thoroughly shaken, and they begin to hear noises of

  people moving in the forest around them.  They start to back cautiously

  away from the hut, suddenly there is heavy footfall behind them.  They

  turn in fear and:



  Sudden CUT TO BIG CLOSE-UP of a frightening black-browed evil face.



                              TALL KNIGHT OF NI

      Ni!



  ARTHUR and BEDEVERE recoil in abject fear.  PATSY rears up with coconuts.



                              ARTHUR

          (to PATSY)

      Easy ... boy, easy ...



  ARTHUR peers into the darkness.



      Who are you?



                              SIX VOICES FROM DARKNESS

      NI! ... Peng! ... Neeee ... Wom!



  An extraordinary TALL KNIGHT in all black (possibly John with Mike on his

  shoulders) walks out from the dark trees.  He is extremely fierce and

  gruesome countenance.  He walks towards KING ARTHUR and PATSY, who are

  wazzing like mad.  (Salopian slang, meaning very scared.  almost to the

  point of wetting oneself, e.g. before an important football match or

  prior to a postering.  Salopian slang meaning a beating by the school

  praeposters.  Sorry about the Salopian slant to this stage direction - Ed.)



                              ARTHUR

          (wazzed stiff)

      Who are you?

                              TALL KNIGHT

      We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!



                              BEDEVERE

      No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!



                              TALL KNIGHT

      The same!



                              ARTHUR

      Who are they?



                              TALL KNIGHT

      We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee

      ... Wom!



                              BEDEVERE

      Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.



                              TALL KNIGHT

      The Knights Who Say "Ni"! demand a sacrifice.



                              ARTHUR

          (to the TALL KNIGHT)

      Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the

      Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...



                              TALL KNIGHT

      NI!



                              ARTHUR

          (recoiling)

      Oh!



                              TALL KNIGHT

      NI!   NI!



                              ARTHUR

          (he cowers in fear)

      Oh!



                              TALL KNIGHT

      We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.



                              ARTHUR

      All right!  What do you want?



                              TALL KNIGHT

      We want ... a shrubbery!



                              ARTHUR

      A what?



                              TALL KNIGHT

      Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!



  The PAGES rear and snort and rattle their coconuts.



                              ARTHUR

      All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you

      a shrubbery ...



                              TALL KNIGHT

      You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall

      not pass through this wood alive!



                              ARTHUR

      Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will

      return with a shrubbery.



                              TALL KNIGHT

      One that looks nice.



                              ARTHUR

      Of course.



                              TALL KNIGHT

      And not too expensive.



                              ARTHUR

      Yes ...



                              TALL KNIGHT

      Now - go!



  ARTHUR and BEDEVERE turn and ride off.



                              OTHER KNIGHTS

      Ni!  Ni!



  Shouts of "Ni" and "Peng" ring behind them.





17 EXTERIOR - DAY



  CUT BACK TO the HISTORIAN lying in the glade.  His WIFE, who has been

  kneeling beside him, rises as two POLICE PATROLMEN enter the glade.

  They bend over her HUSBAND.  One takes out a notebook.



  CUT TO and animated title - "The Tale of Sir Launcelot"





18 INTERIOR - PRINCE'S ROOM IN CASTLE - DAY



  A young, quite embarrassingly unattractive PRINCE is gazing out of a castle

  window.  His FATHER stands beside him.  He is also looking out.  The

  PRINCE wears a long white undershirt (like a night shirt).



                              FATHER

      One day, lad, all this will be yours ...



                              PRINCE

      What - the curtains?



                              FATHER

      No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...

          (indicates the vista from the window)

      all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and

      valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ...

      that'll be your kingdom, lad.



                              PRINCE

      But, Mother ...



                              FA
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 16384 --]
THER

      Father, lad.



                              PRINCE

      But, Father, I don't really want any of that.



                              FATHER

      Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when

      I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a

      castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em.

      It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank

      into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN

      sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up.

      ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in

      this island.



                              PRINCE

      But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...



                              FATHER

      Rather what?



                              PRINCE

      I'd rather ... just ... sing ...



  MUSIC INTRO



                              FATHER

      You're not going to do a song while I'm here!



  Music stops.



      Listen, lad, in twenty minutes you're going to be married to

      a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.



                              PRINCE

      I don't want land.



                              FATHER

      Listen, Alice ...



                              PRINCE

      Herbert.



                              FATHER

      Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all

      the land we can get.



                              PRINCE

      But I don't like her.



                              FATHER

      Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ...

      she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...



                              PRINCE

      I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ...

      a certain ... special ... something ...



  MUSIC INTO FOR song.



                              FATHER

      Cut that out!



  Music cuts off abruptly.



      You're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea!

      Guards!



  TWO GUARDS enter and stand to attention on either side of the door

  One of them has hiccoughs and does so throughout.



                              FATHER

      Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until

      I come and get him.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.



                              FATHER

      No.  Until I come and get him.



                              SECOND GUARD

      Hic.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.



                              FATHER

      No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.



                              FIRST GUARD

      ... and you'll come and get him.



                              SECOND GUARD

      Hic.



                              FATHER

      That's Right.



                              FIRST GUARD

      We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him

      entering the room.



                              FATHER

      Leaving the room.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Leaving the room ... yes.



                              FATHER

      Got it?



                              SECOND GUARD

      Hic.



  FARTHER makes to leave.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Er ... if ... we ... er ...



                              FATHER

      Yes?



                              FIRST GUARD

      If we ... er ...

          (trying to remember what he was going to say)



                              FATHER

      Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't

      leave the room.



                              SECOND GUARD

      Hic.



                              FATHER

      Right?



                              FIRST GUARD

      Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?



                              FATHER

          (carefully)

      No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...



                              FIRST GUARD

      Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had

      to leave and we were with him.



                              FATHER

      No ... just keep him in here.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Until you, or anyone else ...



                              FATHER

      No, not anyone else - just me.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Just you ...



                              SECOND GUARD

      Hic.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Get back.



                              FATHER

      Right.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.



                              FATHER

      And make sure he doesn't leave.



                              FIRST GUARD

      What?



                              FATHER

      Make sure he doesn't leave.



                              FIRST GUARD

      The Prince ... ?



                              FATHER

      Yes ...  make sure ...



                              FIRST GUARD

      Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!

          (he points to the other GUARD and laughs to himself)

      You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when

      he's a guard ...



                              FATHER

      Is that clear?



                              SECOND GUARD

      Hic.



                              FIRST GUARD

     Oh, yes.  That's quite clear.  No problems.



  FATHER pulls open the door and makes to leave the room.  The GUARDS follow.



                              FATHER

          (to the GUARDS)

      Where are you going?



                              FIRST GUARD

      We're coming with you.



                              FATHER

      No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave

      the room until I get back.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Oh, I see,  Right.



  They take up positions on either side of the door.



                              PRINCE

      But, Father.



                              FATHER

      Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!



   He points to a wedding suit on a table or chair.  FATHER throws one last

   look at the BOY and turns, goes out and slams the door.



   The PRINCE slumps onto window seat, looking forlornly out of the window.

   MUSIC INTRO to song ...



   The door flies open, the music cuts off and FATHER pokes his head in.



                              FATHER

       And no singing!



                              SECOND GUARD

      Hic.



                              FATHER

          (as he goes out.)

      Go and have a drink of water.



  FATHER slams the door again.  The GUARDS take up their positions.  The SON

  gazes out of the window again ... sighs ... thinks ... a thought strikes him

  ... he gets up, crosses to his desk and scribbles a quick note and impales

  it on an arrow ... takes a bow down from the wall ... and fires the arrow

  out of the window.



  He looks wetly defiant at the GUARDS, who smile pleasantly.





15 EXTERIOR - A FOREST - DAY



  CUT TO the middle of the forest.  SIR LAUNCELOT is riding along with

  a trusty servant, CONCORDE.



                              LAUNCELOT

      And ... o v e r ...  we go!



  He strides over a big tree trunk ... his "horse" does run and jump ...



                              LAUNCELOT

          (enthusiastically)

      Well taken, Concorde!



                              CONCORDE

      Thank you, sir, most kind ...



                              LAUNCELOT

      And another!



  CONCORDE misses a beat.



      Steady!  Good ... and the last one ...



  CONCORDE does the run-up with the coconuts.  He does the break for the

  leap ... there is a thwack.  SIR LAUNCELOT is waiting for the horse

    to land.



                              CONCORDE

      Message for you, sir.



  He falls forward revealing the arrow with the note.



                              LAUNCELOT

      Concorde - speak to me.



  He realises he might be in danger and so starts to crawl off ...

  when he notices the note.  He takes it out and reads it.



                              LAUNCELOT

          (reading)

      "To whoever finds this note -

      I have been imprisoned by my father who wishes me to marry

      against my will.  Please please please please come and rescue me.

      I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle."



  SIR LAUNCELOT's eyes light up with holy inspiration.



                              LAUNCELOT

      At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...

          (he draws his sword, and turns to CONCORDE)

     Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!



                              CONCORDE

      I'm not quite dead, sir ...



                              LAUNCELOT

          (a little deflated)

      Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally

      wounded in vain!



                              CONCORDE

      I think I could pull through, sir.



                              LAUNCELOT

      Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.



  He makes to leap off dramatically.



                              CONCORDE

      I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.



                              LAUNCELOT

      I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished

      this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.



                              CONCORDE

      Really, I feel fine, sir.



                              LAUNCELOT

      Farewell, Concorde!



                              CONCORDE

      It just seems silly ... me lying here.



  SIR LAUNCELOT plunges off into the forest.



20 EXTERIOR - CASTLE GATEWAY - DAY



  Two hanging banners one each side of the gate with the monogram:

  "H & L".



  TWO SENTRIES with spears ... slightly weddingly ... red ribbons on their

  right spears.  We can hear from inside revelry and celebration music.



  We hear LAUNCELOT's footsteps.  The TWO SENTRIES are watching him.  One of

  them raises his hand.

|

|                              FIRST SENTRY

|      Halt, friend ...

|

  LAUNCELOT leaps into SHOT with a mighty cry and runs the GUARD through and

  hacks him to the floor.  Blood.  Swashbuckling music (perhaps).

  LAUNCELOT races through into the castle screaming.



                              SECOND SENTRY

      Hey!



  He looks down at his mutilated comrade.





21 EXTERIOR - DAY



  CUT TO inside of the castle grounds or courtyard.



  in the sunlight beautifully dressed WEDDING GUESTS are arriving.

  Converging on a doorway.  A country dance in progress.



  SIR LAUNCELOT rushes towards them.



  CUT TO HAND-HELD CLOSE-UPS as he charges through the crowd, hacking

  right and left a la Errol Flynn at all who come in his way.



  He fights his way through the country dance.  Blood.  Shrieks.  Bemused

  looks of GUESTS - not horror so much as uncomprehending surprise.



  Possibly Errol Flynn music.



  One COUNTRY DANCER is left holding just a hand.



  Right and left the GUESTS crumple in pools of blood as he fights his

  way through the door and into the main hall.





22 INTERIOR - DAY



  CUT TO interior of main hall.  Sound of busy preparations.  MEN setting

  up huge hogsheads of wine.  MEN putting up last minute flower arrangements.

  COOKS bearing huge trays of food, pies, suckling pigs, a swan, boar's

  head, etc.



  The BRIDE being dressed by several ATTENDANTS.  FATHER ordering SERVANTS

  around - organizing the STEWARDS etc.



  SIR LAUNCELOT bursts through the middle of them, slashing heroically,

  hacking, wounding and killing.  Again fairly CLOSE-UP chaotic SHOTS.

  We see GUESTS stagger back wounded - a COOK bites the dust, etc.



  SIR LAUNCELOT eventually reaches the staircase ... runs up it and

  into a small door.





23 INTERIOR - DAY



  CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT running up spiral staircase.  He reaches the door

  of the PRINCE's room.  he flings it open.



                              FIRST GUARD

      Ah!  Now ... we're not allowed to ...



  SIR LAUNCELOT runs him through,  grabs his spear and stabs the other

  guard who collapses in a heap.  Hiccoughs quietly.



  SIR LAUNCELOT runs to the window and kneels down in front of the PRINCE,

  averting his head.



                              LAUNCELOT

      Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot,

      from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...

          (he looks up for the first time and his voice trails away)

       away ... I'm terribly sorry ...



                              PRINCE

      You got my note!



                              LAUNCELOT

      Well ... yes ...



                              PRINCE

      You've come to rescue me?



                              LAUNCELOT

      Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...



                              PRINCE

          (his eyes light up)

      I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ...

      there must be ...



  MUSIC INTRO to song.



                              FATHER

          (suddenly looking in the door)

      Stop that!



  Music cuts out.



  FATHER sees SIR LAUNCELOT still kneeling before his son.



                              FATHER

      Who are you?



                              PRINCE

      I'm ... your son ...



                              FATHER

      Not you.



                              LAUNCELOT

          (half standing self-consciously)

      I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.



                              PRINCE

      He's come to rescue me, father.



                              LAUNCELOT

          (embarrassed)

      Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...



                              FATHER

      Did you kill all those guards?



                              LAUNCELOT

      Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...



                              FATHER

      They cost fifty pounds each!



                              LAUNCELOT

      Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ...

      I can explain everything ...



                              PRINCE

      Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot.  I've got a rope here all

      ready ...



   He throws a rope out of the window which is tied to a pillar in the room

   He  looks rather pleased with himself that he has got it all ready.



                              FATHER

      You killed eight wedding guests in all!



                              LAUNCELOT

      Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.



                              FATHER

      I can understand that.



                              PRINCE

          (half out of the window)

      Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!



                              FATHER

          (to his SON)

      Shut up!

          (to LAUNCELOT)

      You only killed the bride's father - that's all -



                              LAUNCELOT

      Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...



                              FATHER

      Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!



                              LAUNCELOT

      Gosh - Is he all right?



                              FATHER

      You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost

      me a fortune!



                              LAUNCELOT

      I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north

      from Camelot ... when I got this note.



                              FATHER

      Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?



  The PRINCE's head peeps over the windowsill.



                              PRINCE

      Hurry!



                              LAUNCELOT

      I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.



                              FATHER

      'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....



                              LAUNCELOT

      Is it?



                     
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 992 --]
         PRINCE (out of vision)

      I am ready, Sir Launcelot.



                              FATHER

      Do you want to come and have a drink?



                              LAUNCELOT

      Oh ... that's awfully nice.



                              PRINCE (OOV)

          (loud and shrill)

      I am ready!



  As they walk past the rope, the FATHER nonchalantly cuts with his knife.

  there is no sound except after a pause a slight squeal from very far away

  as the PRINCE makes contact with the ground.



                              LAUNCELOT

      It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited

      and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...



                              FATHER

      Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own

      that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?



  He puts his arm round LAUNCELOT's shoulders as they go though the door.





24 INTERIOR - DAY



  CUT TO the gre
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 10136 --]
at hall.  GUESTS wounded and bloody, are tending to the dead

  and injured, sighs and groans, the PRINCESS in her white wedding dress is

  holding her chest and coughing blood.

  People dabbing the stains off her dress.



  FATHER and SIR LAUNCELOT start to walk down the grand staircase.  Talking

  to each other.



  One of the GUESTS notices and points to SIR LAUNCELOT.



                              GUEST

      There he is!



  As one man all remaining able-bodied MEN look up and make for the staircase,

  muttering angrily.  SIR LAUNCELOT grabs his sword.



                              FATHER

      Hold it!



  But it is too lake.  SIR LAUNCELOT cannot be stopped.  With fearless abandon

  he throws himself into the CROWD and starts hacking and slashing.  He has

  carved quite a number up before the FATHER can stop him and pulls him back

  onto the stairs.  Renewed groans and cries.





                              FATHER

          (shouting above noise)

      Hold it!  Please!

                              LAUNCELOT

      Sorry!  Sorry ...

          (with bitter self reproach)

      There you See ... I just got excited again and I got carried away ...

      I'm ever so sorry.

          (to the CROWD)

      Sorry.



  CROWD kneeling round their wounded again.  Moans etc.



                              GUEST

      He's killed the best man!



                              SECOND GUEST

          (holding a limp WOMAN)

      He's killed my auntie.



                              FATHER

      No, please!  This is supposed to be a happy occasion!

      Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who ...  We

      are here today to witness the union of two young people in

      the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.  Unfortunately, one

      of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.



  Murmurs from CROWD;  the BRIDE smiles with relief, coughs.



      But I don't want to think I've not lost a son ...

      so much as gained a daughter ...



  Smattering of applause.



      For, since the tragic death of her father ...



                              SHOUT FROM BACK

      He's not quite dead!



                              FATHER

      Since the fatal wounding of her father ...



                              SHOUT FROM BACK

      I think He's getting better!



  FATHER nods discreetly to a SOLDIER standing to one side.  The SOLDIER

  slips off.  FATHER's eyes watch him move round to where the voice

  came from.



                              FATHER

      For ... since her own father ... who ... when he seemed about to

      recover ... suddenly felt the icy ... hand of death upon him.



  A scuffle at the back.



                              SHOUT FROM BACK

      Oh, he's died!



                              FATHER

      I want his only daughter, from now onwards, to think of me as her

      old dad ... in a very real and legally binding sense.



  Applause.



      And I'm sure sure ... that the merger ... er ... the union

      between the Princess and the brave but dangerous Sir Launcelot

      of Camelot ...



                              LAUNCELOT

      What?



  Gasp from the CROWD.



                              CROWD

      The dead Prince!



  There is CONCORDE holding "THE DEAD PRINCE" in his arms.



                              CONCORDE

      He's not quite dead!



                              PRINCE

      I feel much better.



                              FATHER

      You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!



                              PRINCE

      I was saved at the last minute.



                              FATHER

      How?



                              PRINCE

      Well ... I'll tell you ...



  MUSIC INTRO to song.  CONCORDE stands the SON on his feet and adopts cod

  "and now a number from my friend" pose.



                              FATHER

      Not like that!



  But the music doesn't stop and the CROWD starts to sing.



                              CROWD

      He's going to tell.



                              FATHER

      Shut up!



                              CROWD

      He's going to tell ...



                              FATHER

          (screaming)

      Shut UP!



   As the song starts the FATHER tries yelling at them and eventually gives

   up.  SIR LAUNCELOT joins CONCORDE in the CROWD.

|

|                              LAUNCELOT

|      We must escape.  Quickly before the song.

|

|                              CONCORDE

|      Come with me, sir.

|

|                              LAUNCELOT

|      You're not right for this genre ... I must escape more dramatically.

|

+

+                              CONCORDE

+      Quickly, sir, come this way!

+

+                              LAUNCELOT

+      No!  It's not right for my idiom.  I must escape more  ... more ...

+

+                              CONCORDE

+      Dramatically, sir?

+

+                              LAUNCELOT

+      Dramatically.

+

                              CROWD

      He's going to tell

      He's going to tell

      He's going to tell about his great escape.

      Oh he fell a long long way

      But he's here with us today

      What a wonderful ... escape.



  CONCORDE goes.  SIR LAUNCELOT runs back up the stairs, grabs a rope

  of the wall and swings out over the heads of the CROWD in a

  swashbuckling manner towards a large window.  He stops just short

  of the window and is left swing pathetically back and forth.

+

+                              LAUNCELOT

+      Excuse me ... could somebody give me a push ...

+



25 EXTERIOR - A DESERTED VILLAGE - DUSK



  Toothless old CRONE by the roadside.  ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and two PAGES

  ride up and draw up alongside the CRONE.



                              ARTHUR

       Is there anywhere where we could buy a shrubbery?



  The OLD CRONE crosses herself with a look of stark terror.



                              CRONE

      Who sent you?



                              ARTHUR

      The Knights Who Say Ni!



                              CRONE

      Aaaagh!

          (she looks around in rear)

      No!  We have no shrubberies here.



                              BEDEVERE

      Surely, there must be.

|

|  ARTHUR restrains from threatening the LADY.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|          (aside)

|      It will be not good to argue.  These simple people are terrified

|      of the Knights Who Say Ni!

|

|                              CRONE

|          (she cowers)

|      Ohhh!

|

|  ARTHUR takes BEDEVERE further aside.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      There is only one way to get the information we want ...

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|      Send her a letter from a long way away?

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Er, no ... no, we must ...

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|      Talk to her in funny voices?

|

|                              ARTHUR

|          (slightly crossly)

|      No ...

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|      How about trying ourselves to a tree?

|

|                              ARTHUR

|          (grittily)

|      No.  Our only hope is to make her as afraid of us as she is of

|      the awful Knights Who Say Ni!

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|          (sagely)

|      Ah!  Hit ourselves with a big rock ...

|

|  He nods knowingly.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|          (tolerantly but firmly)

|      No.  Nothing we do to ourselves will frighten her as much as

|      what we can do to her ...

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|      Ah!

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      We must threaten to say "Ni"!

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|          (terror)

|      Oh, no.

|

|  They reapproach the OLD CRONE who is cowering more than ever.

|

                              ARTHUR

      Listen, old crone!  Unless you tell us where we can buy a

      shrubbery, my friend and I will ... we will say "Ni!"



                              CRONE

      Do your worst!

|      I have herd the Knights say "Ni"! in the night.  I have herd the

|      hideous Peng! and they have said "Nee-wum"! to my sister but still

|      I have not revealed ...



                              ARTHUR

      Very well, old crone.  Since you will not assist us voluntarily

      ... "Ni"!



                              CRONE

      No.  Never.  No shrubberies.



                              ARTHUR

      Ni!



                              BEDEVERE

      Nu!



                              ARTHUR

      No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!



                              BEDEVERE

      Ni, ni, ni!



                              ARTHUR

|      It's not working.

      You're not doing it properly.  Ni!



                              BEDEVERE

      Ni!



                              ARTHUR

      That's it.  Ni!  Ni!



  A PASSER-BY on a horse is observing them.



                              ROGER

      Are you saying "Ni" to that old woman?



                              ARTHUR

      Erm, yes.



                              ROGER

      Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say "Ni"

      at will to old ladies.  There is a pestilence upon this land!

      nothing is sacred.  Even those who arrange and design

      shrubberies are under considerable economic stress

      at this point in time.



                              ARTHUR

      Did you say shrubberies?



                              ROGER

      Yes.  Shrubberies are my trade.  I am a shrubber.  My name

      is Roger the Shrubber.  I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.



                              BEDEVERE

          (rather aggressively, to ROGER)

      Ni!



                              ARTHUR

      No.  No.  No!





26 EXTERIOR - GLADE - DUSK



  CUT TO the glade in the forest again.



                              ARTHUR

       Oh
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 6248 --]
, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?



                              TALL KNIGHT

      That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly -

      But there is one small problem.



                              ARTHUR

      What is that?



                              TALL KNIGHT

      We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!



                              ONE KNIGHT

      Ni!



                              OTHERS

      Sh!



                              ONE KNIGHT

          (wispers)

      Sorry.



                              TALL KNIGHT

      We are now the Knights Who Go Neeeow ... wum ... ping!



                              OTHERS

      Ni!



                              OTHERS

      Ni!



                              ONE KNIGHT

      Peng!



                              OTHERS

      Ni!



                              OTHERS

      Sh!  Sh!



                              TALL KNIGHT

      Therefore ... we are no longer contractually bound by any agreements

      previously entered into by the Knights Who Say Ni!



                              ONE KNIGHT

      Ni!



                              ANOTHER

      Peng!



                              ANOTHER

      Sh!



                              TALL KNIGHT

      Shut up!

          (to ARTHUR)

      Therefore, we must give you a test, a Test to satisfy the Knights who

      say Neeeow ... wum ... ping!



                              OTHERS

        (terrific chorus)

      Neeeow ... wum ... ping!



                              ARTHUR

      What is this test, Knights of N...

          (can't say it)

      ... Recently Knights of Ni!



                              KNIGHT

      Ni!



                              TALL KNIGHT

      Firstly.  You must get us another shrubbery!



                              OTHER KNIGHTS

          (half seen)

      More shrubberies!  More shrubberies for the ex-Knights of Ni!



                              ARTHUR

      Not another shrubbery -



                              TALL KNIGHT

      When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here,

      beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a

      two-level effect with a path through the middle.



                              OTHER KNIGHTS

      A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!



  Chorus of "Ni!  Ni!"



                              TALL KNIGHT

      When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut

      down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.



                              OTHER KNIGHTS

      Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!



                              ARTHUR

      We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!



                              TALL KNIGHT

      Oh, please!



                              ARTHUR

      Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!



                              OTHER KNIGHTS

          (they all recoil in horror)

      Oh!



                              TALL KNIGHT

      Don't say that word.



                              ARTHUR

      What word?



                              TALL KNIGHT

      I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words

      the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!



                              ARTHUR

      How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?



                              TALL KNIGHT

          (cringing in fear)

      You said it again!



                              ARTHUR

      What, "is"?



                              TALL KNIGHT

          (dismissively)

      No, no ... not "is"!



                              OTHER KNIGHTS

      Not "is"!  Not "is"!



  Suddenly singing is heard from deep in the forest.



                              SIR ROBIN'S SINGERS

      Bravely good Sir Robin was not at all afraid

      To have his eyeballs skewered ...



                              TALL KNIGHT

          (irritated)

      "Is" is all right ... You wouldn't get far not saying "Is"!



                              BEDEVERE

      My liege, it's Sir Robin!



                              TALL KNIGHT

          (covering his ears)

      You've said the word again!



  SIR ROBIN and his SINGERS appear in the clearing.  The SINGERS are going on

  cheerfully as usual and ROBIN walks in front of them, continually

  embarrassed at their presence.



                              SINGERS

      ... and his kidneys burnt and his nipples skewered off ...



  ROBIN holds his hand up for silence.



                              ARTHUR

      Sir Robin!



  He shakes his hand warmly.



                              ROBIN

   My liege!  It's good to have found you again ...



                              TALL KNIGHT

   Now he's said the word!



                              ARTHUR

   Where are you going good Sir Robin?



                              ROBIN'S SINGERS

          (starting up again)

      He was going home ... he was giving up,

      He was throwing in the sponge.



                              ROBIN

          (to SINGERS)

      Shut up!  No ... er ... no ... I ... er ... I ... er ... I certainly

      wasn't giving up ... I was actually looking for the grail ...

      er thing ... in this forest.



                              ARTHUR

      No ... it lies beyond this forest.



                              TALL KNIGHT

      Stop saying the word!



                              OTHER KNIGHTS

      Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...



                              ARTHUR

          (losing his patience with the fearful KNIGHTS OF "NI")

      Oh, stop it!



  Terrific confusion amongst the KNIGHTS OF "NI", they roll on the ground

  covering their ears.  The TALL KNIGHT remains standing trying to control

  his MEN.



                              OTHER KNIGHTS

      They're all saying the word ...



                              TALL KNIGHT

      Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...



                              OTHER KNIGHTS

      You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 5719 --]
 all saying it.



  ARTHUR beckons to BEDEVERE and ROBIN and they pick their way through

  the helpless KNIGHTS OF "NI" and away into the forest.





27 EXTERIOR - HISTORIAN'S GLADE - DAY



  We CUT TO an almost subliminal shot of the HISTORIAN'S WIFE being shown

  into a police car, which then roars off out of the glade



|   CUT BACK to the forest.  The Knights of "NI" are slowly recovering.  they

|   get up.

|

|                              TALL KNIGHT

|      Well, At least We've got ONE shrubbery.

|

|                              OTHER KNIGHTS

|      Yes, Yes ... We've Done very Well ...  NI!

|

|                              TALL KNIGHT

|      Ssh! I think somebody's coming.  We'll get them to give us

|      another shrubbery.

|

|                              OTHER KNIGHTS

|      Good Idea.  More shrubberies.  As many as possible.

|

|   Perhaps we start to TRACK BACK from the scene as they go on talking.

|

|                              TALL KNIGHT

|      What shall we call ourselves this time?

|

|                              KNIGHT

|      How about "The knights of Nicky-Nicky"?

|

|

|28 EXTERIOR - DAY

|

|   A Small group of PEASANTS are being shuffled into a group formation, at the

|   apparent direction of someone behind the camera.  A Few coughs

|   as they shuffle together.  a moment of silence.  then they burst

|   into pleasant (melliflubus) song.

|

|   Song:   When the trees do blossom full

|           and all the hills are green

|           Oh! Oh! We sing

|           hey! hey! We sing

|           our count....ry Song...

|

|   A hail of arrow hits them and they crumple up.  sound of raucous

|   laughter OFF CAMERA.

|

|   CUT TO Reveal a firing squad of ARCHERS kneeling not ten feet away from

|   the group of SINGERS.

|

|   Sitting on the throne on a dais is KING BRIAN THE WILD.  He is roaring with

|   roaring with laughter.  and his court is slightly shabby - bearing all the

|   marks of a faded richness.  it is a court without women, and nobody

|   does the washing or shaves very well. perhaps there is washing however

|   on the line over the castle.  KING BRIAN'S ADVISERS stand around

|   him.   Everyone bears the signs of past injuries (Except for BRIAN

|   himself) I.E. they have an arm in a sling or head bandaged; all the people

|   at court, except for BRIAN have their left arm missing (possibly

|   the result of some violent edict a few years back)

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO! HO! HA! HA! HA! HA!

|      Oh! Very good! Next!

|

|                              FIRST ADVISER

|          (a Little uncomfortably - perhaps his arm is in a sling obviously

|           giving him some pain)

|      There are no more, Sir.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|          (grabbing him by the collar)

|      What do'you mean you filthy dog!

|

|                              FIRST ADVISER

|      There are no more close harmony groups in the kingdom, Sir.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      No more close harmony groups!!!

|

|                              FIRST ADVISER

|      We have scoured the kingdom.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|          (lifting him bodily into the air and breaking his

|           arm again slightly)

|      You Miserable worm! you wretch! You Walking son of a dunghill keeper!

|      Guards!

|

|   Two Rather shabby looking GUARDS approach. (as everyone else they also

|   have their left arms missing)

|

|                              FIRST ADVISER

|      have mercy your MAJESTY!

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|   GUARDS! Take him away and suspend him by his nostrils from the highest

|   tree in the kingdom!

|

|   The Guards grab him unmercifully and drag him off.  he whines piteously.

|

|

|29 EXTERIOR - DAY

|

|   CUT BACK to the glade where the KNIGHTS OF NI! were.  A police car

|   roars up.  Two PLAIN CLOTHES DETECTIVE and a CONSTABLE get out, look

|   around suspiciously, perhaps kneel and examine the ground. one POLICEMAN

|   finds PATSY's shoe and the other finds a strange scientific instrument that

|   was hanging from BEDEVERE.

|

|   They nod grimly to each other. Climb back in the car and drive off.

|

|

|30 EXTERIOR - DAY

|

|   Back in KING BRIAN's Court. the FIRST ADVISER has been dragged off.  there

|   are muffled screams coming from the nearby tree.  the FIRST ADVISER

|   is being hauled up it on pulleys.

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      Your Majesty, I can Find you a Lute player, whose music is passing

|      sweet.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      It's not the same, You thick-headed fool!

|          (KING BRIAN hits him on the back of the head.  he falls.)

|      There's no fun in killing soloists!

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|          (picking himself up)

|      He may have a friend...

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      GUARDS!

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      Oh Please your majesty!  Please!

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Take him away and tie his kidneys to the longest hedge in the kingdom!

|

|   The GUARDS drag the ADVISER roughly away.

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      No!

|          (he is dragged off screaming and protesting)

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|          (roaring at the rest of the court)

|      I will personally disembowel the next little bastard who tells me that

|      there are no more close harmony ...

|

|   At this moment we hear faintly the sound of si
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 4338 --]
nging. KING BRIAN stopped

|   to listen.  The entire COURT turns thankfully towards the mellifluous

|   sounds.

|

|      We're the knights of the round table

|      our shows are formidable

|      but many times we're given rhymes

|      that are quite unsingable...

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Wait a minute! Five point harmony with a counter-tenor lead!

|

|   Various members of the COURT sigh and breathe more easily.

|

|                              CREEP

|      Thank goodness.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Shut up!

|          (punches him right on the end of the nose and shouts to the

|           SECOND ADVISER)

|      Oy you!

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|          (doubled-up, Surrounded by soldiers busy with his stomach)

|      Yes, Your majesty?

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Go and get 'em!

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|          (gratefully)

|       Thank you sir!

|          (He staggers off with some difficulty)

|

|                              GUARD

|      'ere... We'd just started taking his kidneys out.

|

|   CUT TO ARTHUR,BEDEVERE,GALAHAD and LANCELOT.  (Garwin,thrstam, Hecrot)

|   plus all their pages.  there are riding along singing cheerily.

|

|                              KNIGHTS

|      We're baby mad and Camelot

|      we nurse and push the pram a lot

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      HALT!

|

|                              SIR GALAHAD

|      Who are you who dares to halt the knights of king Arthur's round table

|      in mid-verse?

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      I bring greetings from the court of king Brian.

|

|                              SIR LANCELOT

|      King Brian the wild?

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      Some call him that, but he's calmed down allot recently.

|

|                              SIR GALAHAD

|      Are those YOUR kidneys?

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|          (covering his stomach)

|      No no... It's nothing - just a flesh wound.

|          (The KNIGHTS look at each other)

|      he has herd your beautiful melody; and wishes you to come to his court,

|      that he may listen at his ease ooh!

|

|                              SIR LANCELOT

|      You must be joking!

|          (general murmur or agreement from the other KNIGHTS.)

|      Go to the court of king Brian the wild and sing close harmony!

|

|                              OTHER KNIGHTS

|      No fear etc.

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|          (in increasing pain)

|      It need not be close harmony oooh agh!

|

|                              SIR GALAHAD

|      Ah but it would get round to close harmony, wouldn't it?

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      Not necessarily ... As I say king Brian is much more relaxed than

|      he used to be.

|

|                              SIR GALAHAD

|      I mean could we just stick to one line of plainsong with a bit of

|      straight choral work?

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      Well obviously he'd prefer a bit of close harmony arghhh!

|

|                              KNIGHTS

|      Ah! There you are!

|

|                              SIR LAUNCELOT

|      We'd end un-like the Shalott Choral Society.

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      Oh that was an accident - honestly he's so calm now oh!

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      No we must be on our way.

|

|   They start off.

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|          (by now lying on the ground at his last gasp but still trying to

|           sound threatening)

|      If you don't come and sing for him ... ah ... he'll drive ... oh

|      ... iron spikes though your heads.

|

|                              KNIGHTS

|      Ah! That sounds more like Brian the wild!

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|          (looking helplessly at his intestines)

|      He ... he ... still gets irritable occasionall
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 10136 --]
y.

|

|                              SIR GALAHAD

|      Like with close harmony groups.

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      Ooh ... Look if you're scared ...

|

|                              SIR LANCELOT

|      We're not SCARED!

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|          (With his last ounce of strength)

|      Very well! King Brian challenges your to sing before him in close

|      harmony!

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      A challenge?

|

|   The KNIGHTS look at each other rather taken aback but an idealistic glow

|   suffuses KING ARTHUR's eyes as he looks heaven-wards. The other KNIGHTS

|   look at him rather fearfully.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|          (majestacally)

|      It is a challenge.  We cannot refuse.

|

|                              SIR GALAHAD

|      King Brian's a fucking looney.

|

|                              SECOND ADVISER

|      Great!

|          (dies)

|

|                              SIR GALAHAD

|      Are you all right?

|

|   CUT TO KING BRIAN the wild on his dias.  he sees the KNIGHTS enter

|   the arena.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Ah good!

|

|   CUT TO TRUMPETERS who executes a rather bad fanfare full of missed

|   notes.  meanwhile various SHOTS of preparation.

|

|   KING BRIAN settling down.

|

|   KNIGHTS being led up to the podium. the last of the previous close harmony

|   group is being loaded onto a cart and pushed away by the cart driver

|   from scene tow (Perhaps we see him being paid off)

|

|   SHOT of KING BRIAN on his podium and the HERALD being untied and having

|   his gag removed.

|

|   SHOT of ARTHUR and KNIGHTS getting into a group on the podium still

|   rather nervous.

|

|   The fanfare comes to an end, and several wrong notes.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|          (who can't wait)

|      RIGHT! Carry on gentleman.

|

|                              HERALD

|      KING BRIAN SAYS CARRY ON!

|          (wispering)

|      All right ... two tenor lines - I'll take the base.

|

|   They all nod.

|

|      One... Two... Three...

|

|   Sound of Bows being drown very near by.

|

|   ARTHUR looks up and frowns.

|

|   CUT to reveal a line of twenty ARCHERS they all have their left leg

|   missing, but they DO have two arms.

|

|   Their arrows are drawn back and point directly at ARTHUR & CO.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Hold it! Err ... King Brian!

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      What are THEY For?

|          (Indicates the archers)

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Them? they're... just to show you where the audience would be.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Well we'd prefer to do it without an audience.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Oh you've GOT to have an AUDIENCE!

|      We'd rather give a private recital.

|

|                              HERALD

|      THEY SAY THEY'D RATHER GIVE A PRIVATE RECITAL! O WISE GOOD AND JUST

|      KING BRIAN AND NOT THE LEAST BIT WILD!

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|          (to himself)

|      Turds...

|

|   HE nods to the ARCHERS who turn and hop smartly off in step.

|

|                              ONE-LEGGED RSM

|      Left ... Left ... Left, left, left, left

|      Left ... Left ... Left, left, left, left.

|

|   They hop round behind a long fence and disappear from sight

|   (Fence needs to be about 7 or 9 feet high)

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Right! Ready when you are.

|

|                              HERALD

|      KING BRIAN IS READY!

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      And ... One ... Two ... Three ... Four ...

|

|   They are just about to sing when the ARCHERS, bows read and arrows points,

|   peep over the top of the fence.

|

|      HOLD IT!

|

|                              SIR GAWAIN

|          (singing)

|      We're

|

|   Quick flash of ARCHERS sensed to fire, one tires to hold his shot back but

|   fails and fires his arrows by accident in the air.

|

|   Quick flash of FIRST ADVISER who is hanging by his nostrils from the

|   highest tree in the kingdom, moaning, getting hit by the arrow.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      What is it now?

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      We're not entirely happy with the acoustics.

|

|                              HERALD

|      THEY'RE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH...

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      KING BRIAN SAYS SOD THE ACOUSTICS!

|                              ARTHUR

|      In that case we shall just have to perform elsewhere.

|

|                              HERALD

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|          (getting very angry and dribbling slightly)

|      NO! you've GOT to sing on the target are - er - convert ... er ...

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Come on you bastards! Sing close harmony!

|

|   KING BRIAN snaps his finders and the ARCHERS rise above the fence without

|   any pretence it concealment - fitting arrows into their bows.

|

|                              HERALD

|      KING BRIAN CALLS THEM BASTARDS AND DEMANDS TO HEAD CLOSE HARMONY!

|      WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?

|      I said don't.

|

|                              HERALD

|      Sorry, King.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      Right! On the count of three ... one ...

|      THE KING'S SAID ONE!

|

|                              HERALD

|      THE KING'S SAID TWO! THEY'VE ONLY GOT ONE LEFT!

|

|   We hear the sound of bows being drawn back.  Tension mounts.  the KNIGHTS

|   all look pretty grim.  The end is clearly pretty near.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|          (face in a paroxysm of blood-lust)

|      Three!

|

|                              HERALD

|      THREE!

|

|   Sound in the distance of beautiful close harmony singing

|

|      "Bravely, good sir robin was not at all afraid..."

|

|   CUT TO see SIR ROBIN and his MINSTRELS approaching from round a corner

|   of the castle. SIR ROBIN walks a few feet in from of the them looking

|   rather embarrassed.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|          (turning to the sound)

|      FANTASTIC!

|

|   CUT BACK TO ROBIN'S MINSTRELS

|

|      "To have his eyeballs skewered and his kidneys ... argh!"

|

|   They are suddenly pin-cushioned with arrows.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|      HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO! HO!

|      Oh bloody marvellous!

|

|   ROBIN turns and looks at the decimated remains of his MINSTRELS, surprised

|   but relieved.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Sir Robin! this way!

|

|   ARTHUR leads is MEN off the platform and they are joined by their PAGES and

|   make good their escape.

|

|                              KING BRIAN

|

|   HE swings his sword and slices the HERALD'S head off.

|

|                              HERALD'S HEAD

|          (as it rolls away)

|      PRESS FREEDOM INFRINGED!

28 EXTERIOR - BEYOND FOREST - DAY - ANIMATION



  Shots of ARTHUR etc.  Riding out of the forest.  They leave the forest and

  they meet LAUNCELOT and GALAHAD.



                              VOICE OVER

      And so Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to

      find the Enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty-four.

      Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much

      rejoicing.





29 EXTERIOR - ANOTHER LANDSCAPE - DAY - ANIMATION



                              VOICE OVER

      In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's

      minstrels ...  And there was much rejoicing ... A year passed ...



  MONTAGE of shots of the KNIGHTS.



      Autumn changed into Winter ... Winter changed into Spring ...  Spring

      changed back into Autumn and Autumn gave Winter and Spring a miss and

      went straight on into Summer ...  Until one day ...





30 EXTERIOR - WASTES - DAY



  The KNIGHTS are riding along the top of a ridge.  The country is wild and

  inhospitable.  Suddenly some of them see fire in the distance and ride

  towards it.  As they approach they see an impressive WIZARD figure striding

  around conjuring up fire from the ground and causing various bushes and

  branches to burst into flame.



                              ARTHUR

      What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint

      or tinder?



                              TIM

      I am an enchanter.



  ARTHUR looks at BEDEVERE.



                         
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 2896 --]
     ARTHUR

      By what name are you known?



                              TIM

      There are some who call me Tim?



                              ARTHUR

      Greetings Tim the Enchanter!



                              TIM

      Greetings King Arthur.



                              ARTHUR

      You know my name?



                              TIM

      I do.

          (does another fire trick)

      You seek the Holy Grail.



                              ARTHUR

      That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.



                              TIM

          (does another fire trick)

      Quite.



  Ripple of applause from the KNIGHTS.



                              ARTHUR

      Yes we seek the Holy Grail.

          (clears throat very quietly)

      Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.



                              ONE OR TWO KNIGHTS

      Yes it is.



                              ARTHUR

      And so we're looking for it.



                              KNIGHTS

      Yes, we are.



                              BEDEVERE

      We have been for some time.



                              KNIGHTS

      Yes.



                              ROBIN

      Months.



                              ARTHUR

      Yes ... and obviously any help we get is ... is very ... helpful.



                              GALAHAD

      Do you know where it ...



  TIM does another fire trick.



                              ALL OTHER KNIGHTS

      Sssssh!



                              ARTHUR

      Fine ... well er ... we mustn't take up anymore of your time ...

      I don't suppose ... sorry to sort of keep on about it ... you

      haven't by any chance ... aaah ... any idea where one might

      find ... a ... aaa ...



                              TIM

      What?



                              ARTHUR

      A G...g...g...



                              TIM

      A Grail?



  They all jump slightly and look about apprehensively.



                              ARTHUR

      Er ... yes ... I think so.



                              ALL OTHER KNIGHTS

      Yes.



                              TIM

      Yes.



                              KNIGHTS

      Fine.



                              ROBIN

      Splendid!



                              OTHERS

      Yes, marvellous.



  TIM looks thoughtful and they all stand around a little.  Then TIM produces

  another fire trick producing several different colours.



                              ARTHUR

      Look, you're a busy man ...



                              TIM

      Yes, I can help you with your guest.



  Slight pause.



                              ALL OTHER KNIGHTS

      Thank you.  Yes, thank you very much.



                              TIM

      To the north there lies a cave,  the cave of Caerbannog,

  
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 13032 --]
    wherein, carved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock,

      the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged ...



  There is a thunderclap and a wind starts.  They KNIGHTS get nervous.



                              TIM

       ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.



                              ARTHUR

      How shall we find this cave, O Tim?



                              TIM

      Follow!



  The KNIGHTS register delight and wheel round on themselves.



      But follow only if you are men of valour.  For the entrance

      to this cave is guarded by a monster, a creature so foul

      and cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived.

      Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair ...

      therefore sweet knights if you may doubt your strength or courage

      come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty pointy teeth.

+                              ARTHUR

+      What an eccentric performance!

31 EXTERIOR - DAY



  CUT TO impressive rock face with caves in it.  The KNIGHTS are 'riding'

  towards it.  A foreboding atmosphere supervenes.  TIM gives a signal for

  quietness.  ARTHUR shushes the 'horses'.



                              ARTHUR

      Shhh!



  The PAGES decrease the amount of noise they are making with the coconuts

  for a few seconds.  Then there is a burst of noise from them including

  whinnying.



                              BEDEVERE

          (to ARTHUR)

      They're nervous, sire.



                              ARTHUR

      Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.



  TIM takes a strange look at them.  They walk on leaving the PAGES behind.

  After a few more strides TIM halts them with a sign.



                              TIM

      Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!



  CUT TO shot of cave.  Bones littered around.  The KNIGHTS get the wind

  up partially.  A little dry ice, glowing green can be seen at the

  entrance.  Suddenly we become aware of total silence.  Any noises the

  KNIGHTS make sound very exaggerated.  They unsheathe their swords.



                              ARTHUR

      Keep me covered.



  Stir among KNIGHTS.



                              BEDEVERE

      What with?



                              ARTHUR

      Just keep me covered.



                              TIM

      Too late.



                              ARTHUR

      What?



                              TIM

      There he is!



  They all turn,, and see a large white RABBIT lollop a few yards out of the

  cave.  Accompanied by terrifying chord and jarring metallic monster noise.



                              ARTHUR

      Where?



                              TIM

      There.



                              ARTHUR

      Behind the rabbit?



                              TIM

      It is the rabbit.



                              ARTHUR

      ... You silly sod.



                              TIM

      What?



                              ARTHUR

      You got us all worked up.



                              BEDEVERE

      You cretin!



                              TIM

      That is not an ordinary rabbit ... 'tis the most foul cruel

      and bad-tempered thing you ever set eyes on.



                              ROBIN

      You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!



                              TIM

      That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!



                              GALAHAD

|      Oh, fuck off.

+      Get stuffed.



                              TIM

      He'll do you up a treat mate!



                              GALAHAD

      Oh yeah?



                              ROBIN

|      You turd!

+      Mangy scots git!



                              TIM

      Look.  I'm warning you.



                              ROBIN

      What's he do?  Nibble your bum?



                              TIM

      Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a...

      look at the bones.



                              ARTHUR

      Go on, Bors, chop its head off.



                              BORS

      Right.  Silly little bleeder.  One rabbit stew coming up.



                              TIM

      Look!



  As TIM points they all spin round to see the RABBIT leap at BORS'

  throat with an appalling scream.  From a distance of about twenty feet

  there is a tin opening noise, a cry from BORS.  A quick CLOSE-UP

  of a savage RABBIT biting through tin and BORS' head flies off.  The

  RABBIT leaps back to the mouth of the cave and sits there looking

  in the KNIGHTS' direction and growling menacingly.



                              ARTHUR

      Je...sus Christ!



                              TIM

      I warned you!



                              ROBIN

      I done it again.



                              TIM

      Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better

      didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you

      called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.



                              ARTHUR

      Oh, shut up.



                              TIM

          (quietly)

      It's always the same ... if I've said it once.



                              ARTHUR

      Charge!



  They all charge with swords drawn towards the RABBIT.  A tremendous twenty

  second fight with Peckinpahish shots and borrowing heavily also on the

  Kung Fu and karate-type films ensues, in which some four KNIGHTS are

  comprehensively killed.



      Run away!  Run away!



                              ALL KNIGHTS

          (taking up cry)

      Run away!  Run away!



  They run down from the cave and hide, regrouping behind some rocks.  TIM,

  some way away, is pointing at them and laughing derisively.



                              TIM

      Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.



                              ARTHUR

      Who did we lose?



                              LAUNCELOT

      Sir Gawain.



                              GALAHAD

      Ector.



                              ARTHUR

      And Bors.  Five.

+

+                              GALAHAD

+      Three, sir!

+

                              ARTHUR

      Three.  Well, we'll not risk another frontal

      assault.  That rabbit's dynamite.



                              ROBIN

      Would it help to confuse him if we ran away more.



                              ARTHUR

      Shut up.  Go and change your armour.



  ROBIN leaves, walking strangely.



                              GALAHAD

      Let us taunt it.  It may become so cross that it will make

      a mistake.



                              ARTHUR

      Like what?



  GALAHAD cannot find a suitable answer to this.



                              GALAHAD

      Do we have any bows?



                              ARTHUR

      No.



                              LAUNCELOT

      We have the Holy Hand Grenade.



                              ROBIN

      The what?



                              ARTHUR

      The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.  'Tis one of the sacred

      relics Brother Maynard always carries with him.



                              ALL

      Yes. Of course.



                              ARTHUR

          (shouting)

      Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!



  Slight pause.  Then from the area where the 'HORSES' are, a small group

  of MONKS process forward towards the KNIGHTS, the leading MONK bearing

  and ornate golden reliquary, and the accompanying MONKS chanting and

  waving incense.  They reach the KNIGHTS.  The hand grenade is suffused

  with the holy glow.



  ARTHUR takes it.  Pause



                              ARTHUR

      How does it ... er ...



                              LAUNCELOT

      I know not.



                              ARTHUR

      Consult the Book of Armaments.



                              BROTHER MAYNARD

      Armaments Chapter Two Verses Nine to Twenty One.



                              ANOTHER MONK

          (reading from bible)

      And St.  Attila raised his hand grenade up on high saying

      "O Lord bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow

      thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy. "and the Lord did grin and

      people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies

      and orang-utans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and...



                              BROTHER MAYNARD

      Skip a bit brother ...



                              ANOTHER MONK

      ... Er ... oh, yes ... and the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou

      take out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count to three, no more,

      no less.  Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the

      number of the counting shalt be three.  Four shalt thou not count,

      neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.

      Five is right out.  Once the number three, being the third number,

      be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch

      towards thou foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.



                              ARTHUR

      Right.



  He pulls Pin out.  The MONK blesses the grenade as ...



                              ARTHUR

         (quietly)

      One, two

|      , three ...

+      , five ...

+

+                              GALAHAD

+      Three, sir!

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      Three.

+

  ARTHUR throws the grenade at the RABBIT.  There is an explosion and cheering

  from the KNIGHTS.



                              ALL KNIGHTS

      Praise be to the lord.  Huzzah!



32 INTERIOR - CAVE - DAY



  MIX THROUGH TO the KNIGHTS entering the cave.  It is a large cave and as

  they walk inside it we see in the darkness at the side of the cave

  a fearsome looking CREATURE which watches them with some surprise

  as they walk to some writing carved on the back of the cave wall.

  The KNIGHTS are accompanied by BROTHER MAYNARD.



                              ARTHUR

      There!  Look!



                              BEDEVERE

      What does it say?



                              GALAHAD

      What language is this?



                              BEDEVERE

      Brother Maynard, you are a scholar.



                              BROTHER MAYNARD

      It is Aramaic!



                              GALAHAD

      Of course.  Joseph of Aramathea!



                              ALL

      Of course.



                              ARTHUR

      What does it say?



                              BROTHER MAYNARD

      It reads ... "Here may be found the last words of Joseph of

      Aramathea."



  Excitement.



      "He who is valorous and pure of heart may find the Holy Grail

       in the aaaaarrrrrrggghhh..."



                              ARTHUR

      What?



                              BROTHER MAYNARD

       "The Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh..."



                              BEDEVERE

      What's that?



                              BROTHER MAYNARD

      He must have died while carving it.



                              BEDEVERE

      Oh, come on.



                              BROTHER MAYNARD

      That's what it says.



                              ARTHUR

          (miming)

      But if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".

      He'd just say it.



                              BROTHER MAYNARD

      It's down there carved in stone.



                              GALAHAD

      Perhaps he was dictating.



                              ARTHUR

      Shut up.  Is that all it says?



                              BROTHER MAYNARD

      That's all.  "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".



                              ARTHUR

      "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".



                              BEDEVERE

      Do you think he meant the Camargue?



                              GALAHAD

      Where's that?



                              BEDEVERE

      France, I think.



                              LAUNCELOT

      Isn't there a St. Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh's in Cornwall?



                              ARTHUR

      No, that's Saint Ives.



  A muffled roar is heard.

|

|                              ROBIN

|      Hey!

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|      No, that's in Herefordshire.

|

|                              ROBIN

|          (more urgently)

|      No ... HEY!!!

|

|                              LAUNCELOT

|      "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... "

|

|                              ROBIN

|      No!  "Hey"! is surprise and alarm!

+

+                              BEDEVERE

+      Oooooh!

+

+                              LAUNCELOT

+      No "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... " at the back of the throat.

+

+                              BEDEVERE

+      No!  "Oooooh!" in surprise and alarm!

+

  He indicated the entrance of the cave.  They al
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 16384 --]
l turn and look.  There in

  the opening is a huge, unpleasant, fairly well drawn cartoon beast.



                              ARTHUR

      Oh!

                              GALAHAD

      My God!



                              LAUNCELOT

      What is it?



                              BEDEVERE

      I know!  I know!  I Know!



                              ARTHUR

      What?



                              BEDEVERE

      It's the ... oh ...

          (snaps his fingers as he tries to remember)

      it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...



  Another hideous roar.



      That's it!



                              ARTHUR

      What?



                              BEDEVERE

      It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

|

|  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Who was that?

|

|                              HECTOR

|          (from back of group; northern and helpful)

|      It was Sir Alf.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf.

|

|                              HECTOR

|      He was feeding it bread.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|          (shouting back)

|      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand

|      well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

|

|                              HECTOR

|      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

|

|                              ROBIN

|      Look out.

|

|  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.  The KNIGHTS retreat

|  into the darkness of the cave.

|

|                              GAWAIN

|          (as they run)

|      It's only a cartoon.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Sh!



  They run off.  Darkness.  The MONSTER lumbering through on animation.



+                              VOICE OVER

+      As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur

+     and his knights seemed hopeless,  when, suddenly ... the animator

+     suffered a fatal heart attack.

+

+                              ANIMATOR

+      Aaaaagh!

+

+                              VOICE OVER

+      The cartoon peril was no more ... The Quest for Holy Grail

+      could continue.



  ANIMATED SEQUENCE.  Leads through to the group reappearing and seeing a

  distant opening to the cave.  They reach the opening.  It is day.





33 EXTERIOR - DAY



  The KNIGHTS emerge from the mouth of the cave to find themselves in a

  breathtaking, barren landscape.  Glencoe.  They are half they way up

  the side of a mountain.  They rest a few seconds and get their breath

  back.

|

|                              GALAHAD

|     Look!

|

+                              GALAHAD

+     There it is!

+

+                              ARTHUR

+     The Bridge of Death!

+

+                              ROBIN

+          (to himself)

+      Oh! Great ...

|

|   They look and see on the side of the mountain there is a sort of milestone

|   which bears the words:  "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!  5 miles" and an arrow.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      God be praised.  This must be the gorge of which the old man spoke

|      in scene twenty-four.

|

|   The KNIGHTS set off along and rather perilous track edging along

|   the side of the mountain.  GALAHAD is leading.

|

|   MIX THROUGH they are climbing higher.  The path gets more and more

|   slippery and dangerous.  They reach another milestone which says:

|   "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!  4 miles" and an arrow, and "Ni!  82 miles" and

|   an arrow pointing in the opposite direction.  They go on.  It is

|   dangerous and difficult.  Tension in their faces.

|

|   As they are climbing, BEDEVERE turns to ROBIN and ARTHUR.

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|      We must find the bridge ... the Bridge of Death ...

|

|                              ROBIN

|          (to himself)

|      Oh, great!

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|      The Bridge is guarded by a bridgekeeper, who asks each traveller

|      three questions.  And he who answers the three questions can

|      cross in safety.

|

|                              ROBIN

|          (warily)

|      And if you get a question wrong?

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|      You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

|

|34 EXTERIOR - DAY

|

|   CUT TO them struggling along.  Perhaps downhill now.  It is growing misty.

|   SIR LAUNCELOT stops them and points.  They peer.

|

|   CUT TO see in the mist ... a weird bridge with mist swirling up from the

|   gorge below.  We cannot see the other side.

|

|   Beside the bridge an OLD MAN stands, he is the blind soothsayer they

|   met earlier in the forest.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|          (to BEDEVERE)

|      He's the Keeper of the Bridge.  It's the old man.

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|          (swallowing hard)

|      Who's going to answer the questions?

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      You go, Robin, and God be with you.

|

|                              ROBIN

|          (looking round wildly)

|      Er ... I tell you what -

|          (lowering voice)

|      Why doesn't Launcelot go?

|

|                              ARTHUR

|          (considering a moment)

|      Very well ... Sir Launcelot.  Brave Sir Launcelot.  This is the Bridge

|      of Death ...

|

|                              LAUNCELOT

|      Oh, yes sir ... I will take it single-handed.

|          (drawing his sword)

|      I will ...

|

|   ARTHUR restrains him.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      No, hang on.  All we want is for you to approach the old man

|      and he will ask you three questions.  Answer those question as

|      best you can, and we will watch ... and pray.

|

|                              LAUNCELOT

|      Yes, my liege ...

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot!  Be careful ...

|

|   They shake hands, Arthur's eyes moisten.  LAUNCELOT approaches the

|   Bridge of Death.

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Listen to the questions.

+

+                              BEDEVERE

+      Look!  It's the old man from scene 24 - what's he Doing here?

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      He is the keeper of the Bridge.  He asks each traveler five questions ...+

+                              GALAHAD

+      Three questions.

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      Three questions ... he who answers the five questions

+

+                              GALAHAD

+      Three questions.

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      Three questions, may cross in safety.

+

+                              ROBIN

+          (warily)

+      And if you get a question wrong?

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

+

+                              ROBIN

+      Oh ... wacho!

+

+                              GALAHAD

+      Who's going to answer the questions?

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      Sir Robin, Brave Sir Robin you go.

+

+                              ROBIN

+      Hey! I've got a great idea!

+      Why doesn't Launcelot go?

+

+                              LAUNCELOT

+      Yes. Let me.  I will take it single-handed ...

+      I will make feint to the north-east ...

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      No, hang on!  Just answer the five questions ...

+

+                              GALAHAD

+      Three questions ...

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      Three questions ...  And we shall watch ... and pray.

+

+                              LAUNCELOT

+      I understand, my liege.

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      Good luck,  brave Sir Launcelot ...  God be with you.

+

+   LAUNCELOT APPROACHES THE BRIDGEKEEPER.

+

                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      Stop!



  SIR LAUNCELOT stops.  The KNIGHTS watch anxiously.  ARTHUR sniffs briefly

  and glances momentarily down at SIR ROBIN's lower armour.



                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      Who approaches the Bridge of Death

      Must answer me

      These questions three!

      Ere the other side he see.



                              LAUNCELOT

      Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.



                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      What is your name?



                              LAUNCELOT

      My name is Sir Launcelot.



                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      What is your quest?



                              LAUNCELOT

      To find the Holy Grail.



                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      What is your favorite colour?



                              LAUNCELOT

      Blue.



                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      Right.  Off you go.



  SIR LAUNCELOT runs across into the mist.  The bridge perhaps disappears

  into the mist and we cannot see the other side.  ARTHUR and SIR ROBIN

  exchange glances.  ROBIN breathes a great sigh of relief.



                              ROBIN

      That's easy!



                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      Stop!

      Who approacheth the Bridge of Death

      Must answer me

      These questions three!

      Ere the other side he see!



                              ROBIN

      Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.



                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      What is your name?



                              ROBIN

      My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!



                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      What is your quest?



                              ROBIN

      To seek the Grail!



                              BRIDGEKEEPER

      What is the capital of Assyria?



                              ROBIN

          (indignantly)

      I don't know that!



  He is immediately hurled by some unseen force over the edge of the

  precipice.



                              ROBIN

      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!





35 EXTERIOR - DAY



  CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT who is only just arriving on the other side.  He looks

  back across the invisible chasm.  Dimly in the distance he hears:



                              GAWAIN  (OUT OF VISION)

      Sir Gawain of Camelot!



                              BRIDGEKEEPER (OOV)

      What is your quest?



                              GAWAIN (OOV)

      To seek the Holy Grail.

|

|                              BRIDGEKEEPER (OOV)

|      What goes:  black white ... black white ... black white?

|

|                              GAWAIN (OOV)

|      Oh, er ... Babylon!  er ... Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

|

|   SIR LAUNCELOT stands on the other side of the bridge.  In the

|   distance we hear the ritual of questions and then a scream and thud,

|   suddenly a hand lands on LAUNCELOT's shoulder.

|

|                              POLICEMAN (VOICE OVER)

|      Just want to ask you some questions, sir.

|

|    LAUNCELOT turns and reacts.  He is led away.

|

|

|36 EXTERIOR - LAKE - DAY

|

|   CUT TO ARTHUR, GALAHAD and BEDEVERE struggling towards the lake.

|

|                              BEDEVERE

|          (to ARTHUR)

|      How did you know how many wing-beats a swallow needs to

|      maintain velocity?

|

|                              ARTHUR

|      Oh ... when you're king you know all those things.

+

+                              BRIDGEKEEPER

+      What is your favorite colour?

+

+                              GAWAIN

+      Blue ...  No yelloooooww!

+

+   ARTHUR and BEDEVERE step forward.

+

+                              BRIDGEKEEPER

+      What is your name?

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      It is Arthur, King of the Britons.

+

+                              BRIDGEKEEPER

+      What is your quest?

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      To seek the Holy Grail.

+

+                              BRIDGEKEEPER

+      What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      What do you mean?  An African or European swallow?

+

+                              BRIDGEKEEPER

+      Er ...  I don't know that ... Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

+

+   BRIDGEKEEPER is cast into the gorge.

+

+                              BEDEVERE

+      How do you know so much about swollows?

+

+                              ARTHUR

+      Well you have to know these things when you're a king, you know.

+

  Suddenly they appear at water's edge.  They look across the water.  A huge

  expanse disappearing into the mist.  How can they cross?



  Suddenly the air is filled with ethereal music, and out of the mist

  appears a wonderful barge silently and slowly drifting towards them.



  They gaze in wonder.  The mysterious boat comes to where they are standing.

  As if bewitched, they find themselves drawing closer

|   to the boat.  As they are about to step in, a ragged figure looks

|   up at them.

|

|                              BOATKEEPER

|          (he is the same as the BRIDGEKEEPER and the SOOTHSAYER)

|      He who would cross the Sea if Fate

|      must answer me

|      these questions twenty-eight.

|

|   He fixes them with a baleful eye, ARTHUR and BEDEVERE exchange glances,

|   then turn, with minds made up, pick him up bodily and throw him in the

|   water.  They climb into the boat and the boat moves off into the mist

|

|   FADE OUT

|

|

|37 ANIMATION

|

|   A wondrous journey in animation carries them across the lake.

|

|   MIX TO





38 EXTERIOR - DAY



  The boat carries them across a magical lake.  They land and get out of

  the boat, their faces suffused with heavenly radiance, and fall to their

  knees.



  Crescendo on music.



                              ARTHUR

      God be praised!  The deaths of many find knights have this day

      been avenged.



  Music swells.  They bend their heads in prayer, before the castle for

  which they have searched for so long.  Suddenly a voice comes from

  the battlements.



  Music cuts dead.



                              FROG

      Ha ha!  Hello!  Smelly English K...niggets ... and Monsieur Arthur

      King, who has the brain of a duck, you know.



  The KNIGHTS look up.



                              FROG

      We French persons outwit you a second time, perfidious English

      mousedropping hoarders ... how you say:  "Begorrah!"



  ARTHUR stands and shouts.



                              ARTHUR

      How dare you profane this place with your presence!  I command

      you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, open the door to the

      Sacred Castle, to which God himself has guided us!

          (he turns to the KNIGHTS)

      Come.



  ARTHUR and the KNIGHTS advance towards the castle.



                              FROG

      How you English say:  I one more time, mac, I unclog my nose towards you,

      sons of a window-dresser,  so, you think you could out-clever us French

      fellows with your silly knees-bent creeping about advancing

      behaviour.

          (blows a raspberry)

      I wave my private parts at your aunties, you brightly-coloured,

      mealy-templed, cranberry-smelling, electric donkey-bottom biters.



  By this time ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and GALAHAD have reached the door.

  ARTHUR bangs on the door.



                              ARTHUR

      In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred

      castle.



  Jeering from the battlements.



                              FROG

      No chance, English bed-wetting types.  We burst our pimples at you,

      and call your door-opening request a silly thing. You tiny-brained

      wipers of other people's bottoms!



  French laughter



                              ARTHUR

      If you do not open these doors, we will take this castle by force ...



  A bucket of slops land on ARTHUR.  He tries to retain his dignity.



                              ARTHUR

      In the name of God ... and the glory of our ...



  Another bucket of what can only be described as human ordure hits ARTHUR.



      ... Right!

          (to the KNIGHTS)

      That settles it!



  They turn and walk away
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 6784 --]
.  French jeering follows them.



                              FROG

      Yes, depart a lot at this time, and cut the approaching any more or

      we fire arrows into the tops of your heads and make castanets

      of your testicles already.



                              ARTHUR

          (to KNIGHTS)

      Walk away.  Just ignore them.



  ARTHUR, BEDEVERE and GALAHAD walk off.  A small hail of chickens,

  watercress,   badgers and mattresses follows them.  But they are on their

  dignity as they try to talk nonchalantly as they walk away into the trees.



                              FROG

      And now remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!  And, if you think

      you got a nasty time this taunting, you ain't heard nothing yet, dappy

      k...niggets, and A. King Esquire.



|  CUT BACK TO the drenched BRIDGEKEEPER/SOOTHSAYER beside the lake He

|  rises up into SHOT.

|

|                              BRIDGEKEEPER

|      He would cross the sea of fate,

|      Must answer me these questions

|      Twenty-eight.

|

|  CUT TO see he is talking to two PLAIN-CLOTHES POLICEMEN and two

|  CONSTABLES.

|

|                              INSPECTOR

|      All right, put him in the van.

|

|  THE BRIDGEKEEPER is led away and put into a police van.

|

  CUT BACK TO ARTHUR still walking away.  French taunts still audible in

  the distance.



                              FRENCH

      You couldn't catch clap in a brothel, silly English K...niggets ...



                              ARTHUR

          (to BEDEVERE)

      We shall attack at once.



                              BEDEVERE

      Yes, my liege.

          (he turns)

      Stand by for attack!!



  CUT TO enormous army forming up.  Trebuchets, rows of PIKEMEN, siege

  towers, pennants flying, shouts of "Stand by for attack!"  Traditional

  army build-up shots.  The shouts echo across the ranks of the army.

  We see various groups reacting, and stirring themselves in readiness.



                              ARTHUR

      Who are they?



                              BEDEVERE

      Oh, just some friends!



  We end up back with ARTHUR.  He seems satisfied that the ARMY is ready.



  PANNING down the serried ranks, pikes ready, pennants flapping in the

  wind.  Some of the horses whinny nervously,  and rattle their coconuts.



  ARTHUR is satisfied at last.  He addresses the castle.



                              ARTHUR

      French persons!  Today the blood of many valiant knights shall

      bee avenged.  In the name of God, we shall not stop our fight

      until each one of you lies dead and the Grail returns to those

      whom God has chosen.



  ARTHUR lowers his visor, turns to have a last look at ARMY, then:



      CHARGE!



  The mighty ARMY charges.  Thundering noise of feet.  Clatter of coconuts.

  Shouts etc.



  The charge towards the castle.



  Suddenly there is a wail of a siren and a couple of police cars roar

  round in front of the charging ARMY and the POLICE leap out and stop

  them.  TWO POLICEMAN and the HISTORIAN'S WIFE.  Black Marias skid up

  behind them.



  The ARMY halts.

                              HISTORIAN'S WIFE

      They're the ones, I'm sure.



                              INSPECTOR END OF FILM

      Grab 'em!



  The POLICE grab ARTHUR and bundle him into the maria.



  SIR BEDEVERE is led off with a blanket over his head.  They are bundled

  into the black maria and the van drives off.



  The rest of the ARMY stand around looking at a loss.



                              INSPECTOR END OF FILM

          (picks up megaphone)

      All right!  Clear off!  Go on!



  A few reaction shots of the ARMY not quite sure what to do.



                              INSPECTOR END OF FILM

      Move along.  There's nothing to see!  Keep moving!



  Suddenly he notices the cameras.



  As the black maria drives away QUICK SHOT through window of all the

  KNIGHTS huddled inside.



                              INSPECTOR END OF FILM

          (to Camera)

      All right, put that away sonny.



  He walks over to it and puts his hand over the lens.



  The film runs out through the gate and the projector shines on the

  screen.



  There is a blank screen for some fifteen seconds.

|

|  Suddenly jazzy music.  Animated titles.  (A new film completely free

|  with the Monty Python film.)

|

|

|                         "THE CREDITS"

|

|  Four of five minute film (mainly animated) about the credits, i.e it

|  includes the actual credits for the film but is really elaborate.

|

|

|                          THE END

|

+

+  Slushy organ music starts and the houselights in the cinema come on ...

+  organ music continues as the audience leave.

Dear Mike,



The Censor's representative, Tony Kerpel, came along to Friday's

screening at Twinkenham and he gave up his opinion of the film's

probale certificate.



He thinks the film will be AA, but it would be possible, given

some dialogue cuts, to make the film an A rating, which would

increase the audience.  (AA is 14 and over, and A is 5-14).



For an 'A' we would have to:



          Lose as may shits as possible



          Take Jesus Christ out, if possible



          Loose "I fart in your general direction"



          Lose "the oral sex"



          Lose "oh, fuck off"



          Lose "We make castanets out of your testicles"



I would like to get back to the Censor and agree to lose the

shits, take the odd Jesus Christ out and lose Oh fuck off, but

to retain 'fart in your general direction', 'castanets of your

testicles' and 'oral sex' and ask him for an 'A' rating on

that basis.



Please let me know as soon as possible your attitude to this.



Yours sincerely,



Mark Forstater

Gaspar: We are three wise men.
Mother: What?
Melchior: We are three wise men.
Mother: Well, what are you doing creeping under a couch at two o'clock in the morning? That doesn't sound very wise to me.
Balthasar: We are astrologists.
Melchior: We have come from the East.
Mother: Is this some kind of joke?
Gaspar: We wish to praise the infant.
Melchior: We must pay a homage to him.
Mother: Homage? You're all drunk! It's disgusting! Out! Come on, out!
Gaspar: No...
Mother: Barge in here with tales about all the ancient fortune-tellers. Come on, out!
Gaspar: No, no, we must see him!
Mother: Go and praise someone else's brat! Go on!
Melchior: We...we were led by a star!
Mother: Led by a bottle more like! Go on, out!
Melchior: Well, well, we must see him, we have brought presents!
Mother: Out!
Gaspar: Gold, frankincense, myrrh!
Mother: Well, why didn't you say? He's over there. Sorry the place is a...bit of a mess. Well, what is myrrh anyway?
Balthasar: It is a valuable balm.
Mother: A balm?! What are you giving him a balm for? It might bite him!
Balthasar: What?
Mother: That's a dangerous animal! Quick, throw it in the trough!
Melchior: No, it isn't!
Mother: Yes, it is! It's great big uhug...
Gaspar: No, no, no, it is an ointment.
Mother: Oh, well, there is an animal called a balm, or did I dream it? So you're astrologists, are you? Well, what is he then?
Gaspar: Hm?
Mother: What star-sign is he?
Gaspar: Ehm...capricorn.
Mother: Ah, capricorn, eh? What are they like?
Gaspar: Oh, well, he's the son of God, ah, Messiah.
Melchior: King of the Jews!
Mother: And that's capricorn, is it?
Gaspar: Ehm, no, no, no, that's just him!
Mother: Oh, that's good to say, otherwise there'd be a lot of them. Snhff.
Melchior: By what name are you calling him?
Mother: Uhm, Brian.
All three wise men: We worship you, oh Brian, who are lord over us all. Praise unto you, Brian, and to the Lord, our
father. Amen.
Mother: Do you do a lot of this, then?
Gaspar: What?
Mother: This praising.
Gaspar: No, no...no, no.
Mother: Oh, well, ehm, if you're dropping by again, do pop in, huh. And thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense, ahm, but
don't worry too much about the myrrh the next time, all right? Huh. Thank you! Goodbye!
Hen: Gdisk!
Mother: Well, were they nice? Hm! Out of their bloody minds, but still, look at that! Hohoho...hear! Hear! Here, that...that's

Female Singer:
Brian, the babe they called Brian,
he grew, he grew, and grew,
grew up to be, grew up to be,
a boy called Brian. A boy called Brian,
he had arms, and legs, and head, and feet,
the boy, whose name was Brian.

Man sleeping on cloud falling: Aaargh!

Female Singer:
And he grew, he grew, grew, and grew,
grew up to be, yes, he grew up to be,
yes, his name was Brian, a teenager called Brian.
And his face became spotty, yes, his face became spotty,
and his voice dropped down low,
and things started to grow, on young Brian and so,
he was certainly no, no girl named Brian,
not a girl named Brian.

And he started to shave, and have one the wrist,
and want to see girls, and go out and get pissed,
a man called Brian, this man called Brian,
the man they called Brian, this man called Briaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

SATURDAY AFTERNOON

ABOUT TEA TIME

Jesus Christ: How blessed are those who know that he's of God. How blessed are the sorrowful; they shall find consolation.
How blessed are those of gentle spirit; they shall have the earth for their possession. How blessed are those who hunger and
thirst to see right prevail; they shall be satisfied. How blessed are those whose hearts are pure; they shall see God.
Mother: Speak up!
Brian: Sch, quiet, mum!
Mother: Well, I can't hear a thing. Let's go to stoning!
Bignose: Ssch!
Brian: You can go to a stoning anytime!
Mother: Ah, come on, Brian!
Bignose: Will you be quiet!
Bignose's Wife: Don't pick your nose!
Bignose: I wasn't picking my nose. I was scratching it.
Bignose's Wife: You was picking it while you was talking to that lady!
Bignose: I wasn't!
Bignose's Wife: Leave it alone! Give it a rest!
Wiseguy: Do you mind, I can't hear a word he's saying.
Bignose's Wife: Don't you "do you mind" me! I was talking to my husband!
Wiseguy: Well, can't you talk to him somewhere else? I can't hear a bloody thing!
Bignose: Don't you swear at my wife!
Wiseguy: Well, I was only asking her to shut up so that I can hear what he's saying, Bignose!
Bignose's Wife: Don't you call my husband "Bignose"!
Bignose: Well, he has got a big nose.
Bearded Man: Could you be quiet, please? What was that?
Wiseguy: I don't know, I was too busy talking to Bignose!
Spectator I: I think it was "Blessed are the cheesemakers".
Bearded Man's Wife: Aha, what's so special about the cheesemakers?
Bearded Man: Well, obviously it's not meant to be taken literally; it refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.
Wiseguy: See, if you hadn't been going on we'd have heard that, Bignose.
Bignose: Hey, say that once more, I'll smash your bloody face in!
Wiseguy: Oh, better keep listening, might be a bit about "Blessed are the Bignoses".
Brian: Oh, lay off him!
Wiseguy: Oh, you're not so bad yourself, conkface. Where are you two from? Nose City?
Wiseguy: One more time, mate, I'll take you to fucking cleaners!
Bignose's Wife: Language! And don't pick your nose!
Bignose: I wasn't going to pick my nose! I'm gonna thump him!
Spectator II: Hear that, blessed are the Greek!
Bearded Man: The Greek?
Spectator II: Hmm. Well, apparently he's going to inherit the earth.
Bearded Man: Did anyone catch his name?
Bignose's Wife: You're not gonna thump anybody!
Bignose: I'll thump him if he calls me "Bignose" again!
Wiseguy: Oh, shut up, Bignose!
Bignose: Ha, right! I warned you! I really will slug you! Saaah...
Bignose's Wife: Oh, it's the meek! Blessed are the meek! Oh, that's nice, innit? I'm glad they're getting something because they
had a hell of a time.
Wiseguy: Listen, I'm only telling the truth, you have got a very big nose!
Bignose: Hey, your nose is going to be three foot wide across your face by the time I'm finished with you!
Spectator I & Spectator II: Ssch!
Wiseguy: Well, who hit yours then? Goliath's big brother?
Bignose: All right, that's your last warning!
Bearded Man's Wife: Oh, do quiet down!
Bignose hitting Bearded Man's Wife: [Thump]
Bearded Man's Wife: Aiih!
Bignose: Silly bitch, getting in the way!
Bearded Man: Aaargh!
Bignose: Racket all the way...
Mother: Oh, come on, let's go to the stoning!
Brian: All right.
Rogers: Well, blessed is just about everyone with a fested interest in the status quo, if I'm right with you there, Reg?
Reg: Yeah, well, what Jesus quietly fails to appreciate is that it's the meek who're the problem.
Judith: Yes, yes, absolutely Reg, yes, I see!
Mother: Oh, come on, Brian, or they'll have him stoned before we get there.
Brian: All right.
Bignose: Aaargh!
Bearded Man's Wife: Lay off!
Wiseguy: Hey, don't be there, he's just lying there, Bignose. Stop that, there's a rape going on, frankly speaking, it's he that
started it all...

Mother: Ah, how I hate wearing these beards.
Brian: Why aren't women allowed to go to stonings, mum?
Mother: It's written, that's why.
Beard and stone seller: Pssst! Beard, madam?
Woman carrying donkey: Oh, look, I haven't got the time to go to no stonings. He's not well again.
Donkey: Oink! Oink!
Beard and stone seller: Stone, sir?
Mother: No, they've got a lot there, lying around on the ground.
Beard and stone seller: Oh, not like these, sir. Look at this! Feel the quality of that, that's craftmanship, sir.
Mother: Hmm...all right, we'll have two with points and...a big flat one.
Brian: Could I have a flat one, mum?
Mother: Ssch!
Brian: Sorry! Dad!
Mother: Ehm...all right, two points, ahm...two flats and a packet of gravel.
Beard and stone seller: Packet of gravel. Should be a good one this afternoon.
Mother: Hm?
Beard and stone seller: Local boy.
Mother: Oh, good.
Beard and stone seller: Enjoy yourselves!
Women disguised as bearded men: [Scream] [Yell]
Bird: Fuiit!
Priest: Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath...
Matthias: Do I say yes?
Guard: Yes.
Matthias: Yes!
Priest: ...you have been found guilty by the elders of the town of uttering the name of our Lord, and so as a blasphemer...
Women disguised as bearded men: Ooh...
Priest: ...you are to be stoned to death!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aah!
Matthias: Look, I'd had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was: "That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehova!".
Women disguised as bearded men: Oooh!
Priest: Blasphemy! He said it again!
Women disguised as bearded men: Yeah! Yes! Yes!
Priest: Did you hear him?!
Women disguised as bearded men: Yeah! Yes! Yes!
Woman: Really!
Priest: Are there any women here today?
Women disguised as bearded men: Uh...ooh...no...
Priest: Very well. By virtue of the authority vested in me...
Rock thrown at Matthias: [Bladonk]
Women disguised as bearded men: Ooh...
Matthias: Oh, lay off! We haven't started yet!
Priest: Come on! Who threw that? Who threw that stone? Come on!
Women disguised as bearded men: She did! She did! He did! He did! He did!
Woman: Sorry, I thought we'd started.
Priest: Go to the back!
Woman: Oh, dear...
Priest: Always one, isn't there? Now, where were we?
Matthias: Look, I don't think it ought to be blasphemy, just saying "Jehova"!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aiiih! He did!
Priest: You're only making it worse for yourself!
Matthias: Making it worse? How could it be worse? Jehova, Jehova, Jehova!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aiiih!
Priest: I'm warning you! If you say Jehova once more...
Rock thrown at Priest: [Bladonk]
Priest: Right! Who threw that?
Matthias: Hehehe...
Priest: Come on! Who threw that?
Women disguised as bearded men: She did! She did! She did! Him! Him! Him!
Priest: Was it you?
Woman II: Yes.
Priest: Right...
Woman II: Well, you did say Jehova!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aiiih!
Rocks thrown at Woman II: [Multiple Bladonks]
Priest: Stop! Stop! Will you stop that! Stop it! Now, look! No one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle! Do you
understand? Even, and I want to make this absolutely clear, even if they do say Jehova!
Women disguised as bearded men: Aiiih!
Rocks thrown at Priest: [Multiple Bladonks]

Brian: Have I got a big nose, mum?
Mother: Oh, stop thinking about sex!
Brian: I wasn't!
Mother: You're always on about it. Morning, noon and night: "Will the girls like this, will the girls like that? Is it too big, is it
too small?"
Leper I: A fish, sir?
Leper II: Alms for a leper!
Leper III: Alms for a leper!
Ex-leper: Alms for an ex-leper! Bloody donkey-owners, all the same, ain't they? Never have any change. Oh, here they...
touch! Spare a talent for an old ex-leper!
Mother: Buzz off!
Ex-leper: Spare a talent for an old ex-leper!
Mother: A talent? That's more than he earns in a month!
Ex-leper: Half a talent then?
Mother: No, get away!
Ex-leper: Come on Bignose, let's haggle!
Brian: What?
Ex-leper: All right, cut the haggling, let's say you open at one shekel, I start at 2000, we close at about 1800.
Brian: No.
Ex-leper: 1750?
Mother: Go away!
Ex-leper: 1740?
Mother: Look, will you leave him alone!
Ex-leper: All right. Two shekels, just two. Isn't this fun, eh?
Mother: Look, he is not giving you any money, so piss off!
Ex-leper: All right sir, my final offer, half a shekel for an old ex-leper?
Brian: Did you say ex-leper?
Ex-leper: That's right, sir. Sixteen years behind a bell and fradock, sir.
Brian: Oh...what happened?
Ex-leper: I was cured, sir.
Brian: Cured?
Ex-leper: Yes, a bloody miracle, sir. God bless you!
Brian: Oh, who cured you?
Ex-leper: Jesus did, sir. I was hopping along, minding my own business, all of a sudden up he comes, cures me. One minute
I'm a leper with a trade, next minute I'm alive and newsgone. Not so much as a bye or league! "You're cured, mate". Bloody
do-gooder.
Brian: Tough. Why don't you go and tell him that you want to be a leper again?
Ex-leper: Aah, I could do that sir, yeah. Yeah, I could do that, I suppose. Well, what the thing was I was going to ask him if
he'd make me a bit lame in one leg during the middle of the week. You know, something peckable but not leprosy, which is a
pain in the ass, to be blunt despute my French servant.
Mother: Brian! Come and clean your room out!
Brian: Here you are.
Ex-leper: Thank you, sir. Than...half a dinare for me bloody life story?
Brian: There's no pleasing some people.
Ex-leper: That's just what Jesus said, sir!

Brian: What's he doing here?
Mother: Ehm...ah, don't start that Brian, ehm...go and clean your room out.
Brian: The bloody Romans!
Mother: Now, look Brian! If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have all this. And don't you forget it.
Brian: We don't owe the Romans anything, mum.
Mother: Oh, that's not entirely true, is it, Brian?
Brian: What do you mean?
Mother: Well...you know when you were asking me about your...
Brian: My nose?
Mother: Yes, well...there's a reason it's like it is, Brian.
Brian: What is it?
Mother: Oh, well, I suppose I should have told you a long time ago, but...
Brian: What?
Mother: Well, Brian, your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
Brian: I never thought he was!
Mother: Now none of your cheek! He was a Roman, Brian. He was a centurion in the Roman army.
Brian: You mean...you were raped?!
Mother: Well...at first, yes.
Brian: Who was it?
Mother: Huh...Naughtius Maximus his name was. Hmm...promised me the known world, he did. I was to be taken to Rome,
house by the Forums, slaves, asses' milk, as much gold as I could eat. Then he, having his way with me he had; voom! Like a
rat out of an aqueduct.
Brian: He's a bastard!
Mother: Yes, and next time you go on about the "bloody Romans", don't forget you're one of them.
Brian: I'm not a Roman mum, and I never will be. I'm a kike, a jid, a heebe, a hooknose! I'm kosher, mum! I'm a red-sea
pedestrian and proud of it!
Brian closing door: [Bladonk]
Mother: Huh...sex, sex, sex, that's all they think about, eh? Hm. Well, how are you then, officer?

Speaker's Voice: Ladies and gentlemen! The next contest is between: Frank the Loyal, the Macedonian baby smacker, and
Boris Fineburn.
Brian: Ah, right, thank you, madam. Lark's tongues! Wren's livers! Chaffinch's brains! Jaguar's earlobes! Wolve's nibble chips!
Get them while they're off, they're lovely. Dromedary pretzel verily after dinner! Tuscany fried bats!
Judith: I do feel Reg, that any anti-imperialistic group like ours must reflect such a divergence of interest within its
powerbase.
Reg: Agreed. Rogers?
Rogers: Yes, I think Judith's point of view is very valid, Reg, provided the movement never forgets that it is the unalienable
right of every man...
Stan: Or woman.
Rogers: ...or woman to rid himself...
Stan: Or herself.
Rogers: ...or herself...
Reg: Agreed.
Rogers: Thank you, brother.
Stan: Or sister.
Rogers: Or sister...where was I?
Reg: I think you'd finished.
Rogers: Oh. Right.
Reg: Further more, it it the birthright of every man...
Stan: Or woman.
Reg: Why don't you shut up about women, Stan? You're putting us off.
Stan: Women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement, Reg.
Rogers: Why are you always on about women, Stan?
Stan: I want to be one.
Reg: What?
Stan: I want to be a woman. From now on, I want you all to call me Loretta.
Reg: What?
Loretta: It's my right as a man.
Judith: Well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
Loretta: I want to have babies.
Reg: You want to have babies?!
Loretta: It's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
Reg: But...you can't have babies!
Loretta: Don't you opress me!
Reg: I'm not opressing you, Stan. You haven't got a womb. Where is the foetus going to gestate? You're going to keep it in a
box?
Loretta: Sniff.
Judith: Here, I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies, not having a womb, which is nobody's
fault, not even the Romans', but that he can have the right to have babies.
Rogers: Good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors for your right to have babies, brother. Sister! Sorry.
Reg: What's the point?
Rogers: What?
Reg: What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies, when he can't have babies?
Rogers: It is symbolic of our struggle against opression.
Reg: Symbolic of his struggle against reality.

Brian: Haven't got any nuts, sorry. I've got wren's livers, badger spleens...
Reg: No, no, no...
Brian: Otters' noses?
Reg: I don't want any of that Roman rubbish!
Judith: Why don't you sell proper food?
Brian: Proper food?
Reg: Yeah, not those rich imperialist tippets!
Brian: Oh, don't blame me, I didn't ask to sell this stuff!
Reg: All right, bag of otter's noses, then.
Rogers: Make it two.
Reg: Two.
Rogers: Thanks, Reg.
Brian: Are you the Judean People's Front?

Rogers: Blighters...
Brian: Can I...join your group?
Reg: No, piss off!
Brian: I didn't want to sell this stufff, it's only a job! I hate the Romans as much as anybody!
All in PFJ except Brian: Ssch! Ssch! Ssch! Ssch! Ssch!
Brian: Oh.
Judith: Are you sure?
Brian: Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans already.
Reg: Listen! If you wanted to join the PFJ, you'd have to have really hate the Romans.
Brian: I do!
Reg: Oh, yeah, how much?
Brian: A lot!
Reg: Right, you're in. Listen, the only people we hate more than the Romans, are the fucking Judean People's Front.
All in PFJ except Brian: Yeah!
Judith: Splitters!
Rogers: And the Judean Popular People's Front!
All in PFJ except Brian: Yeah! Splitters!

Reg: We may have a little job for you, Brian.

Centurion: What's this then? Romanes eunt domus? People call around marnays they go the house?
Brian: It...it says: "Romans go home."
Centurion: No, it doesn't.
Brian: Aih.
Centurion: What's Latin for Romans? Come on!
Brian: Aih! Aah! Romanus!
Centurion: Goes like...?
Brian: Anis?
Centurion: Vocative plural of anis is...?
Brian: Ani?
Centurion: Romani...Eunt? What is eunt?
Brian: "Go"! De...
Centurion: Conjugate the verb "go"!
Brian: Aah...ere, eo, is, it, imus, itis, eunt.
Centurion: So eunt is...?
Brian: Aah, ehm...third person plural present indicative. Ehm..."they go".
Centurion: But "Romans go home" is an order, so you must use the...?
Brian: Aih! Imperative!
Centurion: Which is...?
Brian: Ehm, oh...oh, ehm...i, i!
Centurion: How many Romans?
Brian: Aah! it's...plural, plural! Ite! Ite!
Centurion: Ite.

Centurion: Domum...um. Understand?
Brian: Yes, sir!
Centurion: Now, write that a hundred times!
Brian: Yes, sir! Thank you, sir! Hail Caesar, sir!
Centurion: Hail Caesar! And if it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off.
Brian: Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you, sir! Hail Caesar and everything, sir! Aah. Mmh! Aah... Finished! Aah.
Roman Soldier: Right. Now, don't do it again!
Man with bag: Hey! Bloody Romans...

Rogers: We get in through the underground heating-system here ,up through an inamane audience chamber here, and Pilate's
wife's bedroom is here. Having grabbed his wife, we inform Pilate that she is in our custody, and fore with issue our demands.
Any questions?
Revolutionary I: What exactly are the demands?
Reg: We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle the entire apparatus of the Roman imperialist state, and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.
Matthias: Cut her head off?
Rogers: Cut all her bits off! Send them back on the hour, every hour! Seldom why not to be tried for it.
Reg: And of course, we point out that they bear full responsibility when we chop her up, and that we shall not submit to
blackmale.
All revolutionaries except Reg: No blackmale!
Reg: They bled us white, the bastards. They've taken everything we had. And not just from us! From our fathers, and from
our father's fathers.
Loretta: And from our father's father's fathers.
Reg: Yeah.
Loretta: And from our father's father's father's fathers.
Reg: Yeah, all right Stan, don't delay with the point. And what have they ever given us in return?
Revolutionary I: The aqueduct?
Reg: What?
Revolutionary I: The aqueduct.
Reg: Oh. Yeah, yeah, they did give us that, ah, that's true, yeah.
Revolutionary II: And the sanitation.
Loretta: Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city used to be like.
Reg: Yeah, all right, I'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation, the two things the Romans have done.
Matthias: And the roads.
Reg: Oh, yeah, obviously the roads. I mean the roads go without saying, don't they? But apart from the sanitation, the
aqueduct, and the roads...
Revolutionary III: Irrigation.
Revolutionary I: Medicine.
Revolutionary IV: Education.
Reg: Yeah, yeah, all right, fair enough.
Revolutionary V: And the wine.
All revolutionaries except Reg: Oh, yeah! Right!
Rogers: Yeah! Yeah, that's something we'd really miss Reg, if the Romans left. Huh.
Revolutionary VI: Public bathes.
Loretta: And it's safe to walk in the streets at night now, Reg.
Rogers: Yeah, they certainly know how to keep order. Let's face it; they're the only ones who could in a place like this.
All revolutionaries except Reg: Hahaha...all right...
Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh-water
system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?
Revolutionary I: Brought peace?
Reg: Oh, peace! Shut up!
Judith: [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] ... [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock] [Knock]
Matthias: I'm a poor man, my sight is sore, my legs are old and bented.
Judith: All right, Matthias.
Matthias: It's all clear.
Judith: Well, where's Reg?
Rogers: Oh, Reg! Reg! Judith!
Reg: What went wrong?
Judith: The first blow has been struck!
Reg: Did he finish the slogan?
Judith: A hundred times! In letters ten foot high, all the way around the palace!
Reg: Oh, great! Great! We...we need doers in our movement Brian, but...before you join us, know this: there is not one of us
here who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country the Romans once and for all.
Revolutionary VII: Ehm...well, one.
Reg: Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one. But otherwise we're solid. Are you with us?
Brian: Yes!
Reg: From now on you shall be called "Brian that is called Brian". Fill him in about the raid on the Pilate's palace, Francis.
Rogers: Right! This is the plan!

Rogers: Now, this is the palace at Caesar Square. Our commando-unit will approach from Fish Street under cover of night,
and make our way to the north-western main drain. If questioned, we are sewage workers on our way to a conference. Reg,
our glorious leader and founder of the PFJ, will be co-ordinating the assailant at the drain heighin. Though he himself will not
be taking part in any terrorist action, as he has a bad back.

Revolutionary VIII: Aren't you going to come with us?
Reg: Solidarity, brother!
Revolutionary VIII: Oh, yes...solidarity, Reg.

Rogers: Once in the sewer, timing will be of the essence. There's a Roman feast later in the evening, so we must move fast. And
don't wear your best sandals. Turning left here, we enter the Caesar Augustus' Memorial Sewer, and from there proceed
directly to the hypocaust. This has just been retiled, so terrorists: careful with those weapons! We will now be directly beneath
Pilate's audience chamber itself. This is the moment for Habakkuk to get out his prom.

Habakkuk's Prom: 11*[Konk]

Terrorists' leader: Campaign for fFree Galilee!
Rogers: Oh, ehm...People's Front of Judea. Officials.
Terrorists' leader: Oh.
Rogers: What's your group doing here?
Terrorists' leader: We're going to kidnap Pilate's wife, take her back, issue demands.
Rogers: So are we.
Terrorists' leader: What?
Rogers: That's our plan.
Terrorists' leader: We were here first.
Rogers: What do you mean?
Terrorists' leader: We thought of it first.
Loretta: Oh, yeah?
Terrorists' leader: Yeah. It's a couple of years ago.
All revolutionaries: Ohohoh...
Terrorists' leader: We did!
Rogers: Okay, ohkokh, come on. You got all your demands worked out, eh?
Terrorists' leader: Of course we have!
Rogers: What are they?
Terrorists' leader: Well, I'm not telling you!
Rogers: Oh, come on! Tell me another one!
Terrorists' leader: Arghule complaining! We thought of it before you!
Loretta: Did not!
Rogers: You did not!
Terrorists' leader: We did!
Rogers: You did not!
Terrorists' leader: We did!
Rogers: You did not!
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Rogers and terrorist leader: Ssch! Ssch!
Terrorists' leader: You bastards! We've been planning this for months!
Rogers: Well, tough ticking for you, fish face! Aoh, ooh! Sorry!
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Brian: Ah, ouh! You slime! Sorry! Arrgh!
Brian: Brothers, brothers! We should be struggling together!
Rogers: We are! Oh!
Brian: We mustn't fight each other! Surely, we should be united against the common enemy!
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Brian: The Judean People's Front?!
Brian: No, no, the Romans!
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Brian: Oh, yeah...yeah. Yes. Yeah, he's right.
Terrorist I: Look out!
Rogers: Careful!
Terrorists' leader: Right! Where were we?
Rogers: Ehm...you were going to punch him. Aah, eh.
Terrorists' leader: Oh, yeah. Auh, eh.
All terrorists and revolutionaries except Brian: Aouh! Arrgh! [Thump][Thump] Arrgh...aie!

Prisoner: You lucky, lucky bastard!
Brian: What?
Prisoner: Probably the little jailies' pet, aren't we?
Brian: What do you mean?
Prisoner: You must have slipt him a few shekels, eh?
Brian: Slipt him a few shekels? You saw him spit in my face!
Prisoner: Oh, ohoh, what wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face? I sometimes hang awake at night, dreaming of being spat at
in the face.
Brian: Well, it's not exactly friendly, is it? They had me in manacles!
Prisoner: Manacles! Ohuuhoh...what idea of reaving; is to be allowed to put in manacles, just for a few hours. They must
think a sun shines out your arse, sonny!
Brian: Oh, lay off me, I've had a hard time!
Prisoner: You've had a hard time!? I've been here five years, they only hung me the right way up yesterday! So don't you
come 'round...
Brian: All right, all right!
Prisoner: They must think you're lord God Almighty.
Brian: What will they do to me?
Prisoner: Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion.
Brian: Crucifixion?!
Prisoner: Yeah. First offense.
Brian: Get away with crucifixion?! It's...
Prisoner: Best thing the Romans ever did for us.
Brian: What?
Prisoner: Oh, yeah. If we didn't have crucifixion, this country'd be in a right bloody mess.
Brian: Guard!
Prisoner: Nail 'em up I say!
Brian: Guard!
Prisoner: Nail some sense into 'em!
Jailor I: Hahrkhm...what do you want?
Brian: I want you to move me to another cell.
Jailor I: Hah! Ptui! [Spit]
Brian: Aehw!
Prisoner: Oh! Look at that! Bloody favouritism!
Jailor I: Shut up, you!
Prisoner: Sorry!
Jailor I: Huah! Huhuhu...
Prisoner: Now take my case. They hang me up here five years ago. Every night they take me down for twenty minutes, then
they hang me up again. Which I guard as very fair, in view of what I've done. And if nothing else, it has taught me to respect
the Romans, and it has taught me that you'll never get anywhere in this life, unless you are prepared 
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 12576 --]
to do a fair day's work
for a fair day's...
Brian: Oh, shut up!
Jailor I: Here.
Centurion: Pilate wants to see you!
Brian: Me?
Centurion: Come on!
Brian: Pilate? What does he want to see me for?
Centurion: I think he wants to know which way you want to be crucified.
Prisoner: Oh, hahahaha, haha! Nice one, centurion! Like it, like it.
Centurion: Shut up!
Prisoner: Right, right. Terrific race, the Romans! Terrific.

Brian: All right, I'll give you nineteen then.
Vendor: No, no, no, come on, do it properly!

Vendor: Haggle properly, this isn't worth nineteen!
Brian: Well, you just said it was worth twenty!
Vendor: Oh dear, oh dear. Come on: haggle!
Brian: Uh, all right, I'll give you ten.
Vendor: That's more like it! Ten? Are you trying to insult me? Me, with a poor dying grandmother? Ten!?
Brian: All right, I'll give you eleven!
Vendor: Now you're getting it. Eleven!? Did I hear you right? Eleven? This cost me twelve, you want to ruin me?
Brian: Seventeen?

Vendor: Offer me fourteen.
Brian: I'll give you fourteen.
Vendor: He's offering me fourteen for this!
Brian: Fifteen!
Vendor: Seventeen. My last word, I won't take a penny less, or strike me dead.
Brian: Sixteen!
Vendor: Done! Nice to do business with you.
Brian: Mhm.
Vendor: Tell you what: I'll throw you in this as well.
Brian: I don't want it, but thanks.
Vendor: Burt!
Burt: Yeah.
Brian: All right, all right, all right.
Vendor: Now where's the sixteen you owe me?
Brian: I just gave you twenty.
Vendor: Oh yeah, that's right, that's four I-owe-you, then.
Brian: No, that's all right, that's fine, that's fine.
Vendor: No, hang on, I've got it here somewhere.
Brian: No, it's all right, that's four for the gourd.
Vendor: Four? For this gourd? Four!? Look at it! It's worth ten if it's worth a shekel!
Brian: You just gave it to me for nothing!
Vendor: Yes, but it's worth ten.
Brian: All right, all right!
Vendor: No, no, no, no, it's not worth ten, you're supposed to argue! "Ten for that, you must be mad!" Oh, well, one born

Fat Centurion: Get a move on, there!
Wiseguy: Or what?
Fat Centurion: Or you'll be in trouble!
Wiseguy: Oh, dear. You mean I won't have to give up being crucified in the afternoons?
Fat Centurion: Shut up!
Wiseguy: That would be a blow, wouldn't it? I wouldn't have nothing to do!
Fat Centurion's hand against Wiseguy's shoulder: [Bladonk]
Wiseguy: Oh, thank you!

Door as it slams against the wall whilst being opened by Centurion: [Bladonk]
Centurion: Are they gone?

Jailor I: Huhuh...huhuh...
Jailor II: Anyway, get on with the story.
Jailor I: Well, I never really liked them, so I just...

Reg: Right! That's the motion to get on with it past with but one obstention. And I propose that we go without further ado.
May I have a second there for...?
Rogers: Yes, let's go.
Reg: Yeah. All right.

Centurion: Go away!
Man getting pushed in the face by the Centurion: Ouf! Bloody Romans!
Centurion: Watch it! Still a few crosses left!

Fat Centurion: Up you go, Bignose!
Bignose: Oh, I'll get you for this, you bastard!
Fat Centurion: Oh, yeah!
Bignose: Oh yeah, don't worry. I never forget a face.
Fat Centurion: No!
Bignose: I warn you. I'm gonna punch you stone hard, you Roman git!
Fat Centurion: Shut up, you Jewish turd!
Bignose: Who are you calling Jewish? I'm not Jewish, I'm a Samaritan!
Bearded Man: A Samaritan? This is supposed to be a Jewish section!
Fat Centurion: It doesn't matter! You're all gonna die in a day or two!
Bearded Man: It may not matter to you, Roman, but it certainly matters to us. Doesn't it, darling?
Bearded Man's Wife: Oh, rather!
Bearded Man: Under the terms of the Roman occupancy we're entitled to be crucified in a purely Jewish area.
Crucified man I: Pharisees separate from Sadduces!
Crucified man II: And Swedish separate and Welsh!
Crucifixion Party: Yeah, right, yeah!
Fat Centurion: All right, all right, all right, we'll soon settle this! 'Ands up, all those who don't want to be crucified here!
Crucifixion Party: Ugh! Aah!
Fat Centurion: Right! Next!
Samson: Ah, look, it's not my cross.
Fat Centurion: What?
Samson: Ah, it's not my cross, I was ehm...holding it for someone.
Fat Centurion: Just lie down, I haven't got all day!
Samson: No, of course, ehm, look, I hate to make fuss, but...
Fat Centurion: Look...
Samson: Eh...
Fat Centurion: We've had a busy day, and there's a hundred and forty of you lot together...
Bearded Man: Is he Jewish?
Fat Centurion: Will you be quiet!
Bearded Man: We don't want any more Samaritans around here.
Fat Centurion: Belts up!
Samson: Ehm...would you let me down if he comes back?
Fat Centurion: Yeah, yeah, we'll let you down. Next!
Brian: You don't have to do this! You don't have to take orders!
Fat Centurion: I like orders!

Wiseguy: See? Not so bad once you're up. You're being rescued then, are you?
Brian: I'ts a bit...late for that now, isn't it?
Wiseguy: Oh, no, no, we've got a couple of days up here. Plenty of time. Lots of people get rescued.
Brian: Oh?
Wiseguy: Oh, yeah. My brother usually rescues me. If he can keep off the tail for more than twenty minutes. Huh.
Brian: Aah?
Wiseguy: Randy little bugger. Up and down like the Assyrian empire. Huhuhuhuhuh. Hallo. Your family arrived then?
Brian: Reg!
Reg: Hello, sibling Brian.
Brian: Thank God you've come, Reg.
Reg: Ehm...yes. Well, I think I should point out first Brian in all fairness that we are not in fact the rescue committee, however
I have been asked to read out the following prepared statement on behalf of the movement, ehm...: "We the People's Front of
Judea, brackets, Officials, end brackets, do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisternal greetings to you, Brian on this,
the occasion of your martyrdom..."
Brian: What?
Reg: "...your death will stand as a landmark in the continuing struggle to liberate the parent land from the hands of the Roman
imperialist aggressors, excluding those concerned with drainage, medicine, roads, house and education, wineculture, and any
other Romans contributing to the welfare of Jews, of both sexes and hermaphrodites. Signed on behalf of the P.F.J. etcetera."
And I'd just like to add on a personal note, my own admiration for what you're doing for us, Brian, and what must be after all
for you a very difficult time.
Brian: Reg! Wh...what are you going to do?
Reg: Good-bye Brian, and thanks.
Rogers: All right, Brian. Keep it up, lad.
Loretta: Terrific work, Brian.
Reg: Yeah. Right.
Loretta, Rogers, Revolutionary III and Revolutionary VI: With? Mhm.
Reg: And...

People's Front of Judea Committee:
For he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow,
for he's a jolly good fellow,
and so say all of us.

Loretta:
And so say all of...

People's Front of Judea Committee: [Applause]
Brian: You bastards! You bastards! You vacuous malodorous bastards!
Centurion: Where is Brian of Nazareth? I have an order for his release.
Brian: You stupid bastards!
Wiseguy: Ehm...I'm Brian of Nazareth.
Brian: What?
Wiseguy: Yeah, I-I-I'm Brian of Nazareth.
Centurion: Take him down!
Brian: I'm Brian of Nazareth!
Crucified man I: I'm Brian!
Bignose: I'm Brian!
Crucified man II: Look, look, I'm Brian!
Brian: I'm Brian!
Bearded Man: I'm Brian and so is my wife!
Crucifixion party: I'm Brian!
Centurion: Right! Take him away and release him!
Wiseguy: No, I'm only joking. I'm not really Brian. No, I'm not Brian! I was only...believe me, it was a joke. I'm only pulling
your leg! It's a joke! I'm not him, I'm just having you on! Put me back! Bloody Romans, can't take a joke.
Crucifixion Assistant I: The Judean People's Front!
Fat Centurion: The Judean People's Front!
Judean People's Front Commander: Forward, all!
Crucifixion Assistant II: Look out! The Judean People's Front!
Crucifixion Assistant III: The Judean People's Front!
Crucifixion Assistant IV: The Judean People's Front!
Judean People's Front Commander: We are the Judean People's Front, crack suicide squad. Suicide squad...attack!
Judean People's Front committing suicide: Augh! Arrgh...
Judean People's Front Commander: That showed them, huh?
Brian: You silly sods!
Judith: Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!
Brian: Judith!
Judith: Terrific! Great! Reg has explained it all to me, and I think it's great what you're doing. Thank you, Brian, I'll...I'll never
forget you.
Mother: So, there you are! I might have known it would end up like this. Just think of all the love and affection I've wasted on
you! Well, if that's how you treat your poor old mother, in the autumn years of her life, all I can say is: "Go ahead! Be
crucified! See if I care!". I might have known...
Brian: But mum!
Mother: Not fine thee...said...said...
Brian: Mum! Mum!
Mother: ...like all young people nowadays, I don't know what the world is coming to...
Crucifixion Party: [Silence]
Crucified Man III: Cheer up, Brian! You know what they say?

Crucified Man III:
Some things in life are bad
they can really make you mad,
other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on life's gristle,
don't grumble, give a whistle!
And this'll help things turn out for the best:
And...always look on the bright side of life,

Crucified Man III: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III:
Always look on the light side of life,

Crucified Man III: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III:
If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten,
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing,
when you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly chumps,
just perch your lips and whistle, that's the key.
And always look on the bright side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucifixioned Man III: Come on!

Crucifixioned Man III:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III & Crucified Man IV:
For life is quite absurd, and death's the final word,
you must always face the curtain with a bow,
forget about your sin, give the audience a grin,

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
enjoy, it's your last chance anyhow.
So, always look on the bright side of death.

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
Ah, just before you draw your terminal breath,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III:
Life's a piece of shit, when you look at it,
life's a laugh, and death's a joke, it's true.
You'll see it's all a show, people laughing as you go,
just remember that the last laugh is on you!

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
And always look on the bright side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
Always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucifixioned Man III: Come on, Brian! Cheer up!

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
Always look on the bright side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucifixioned Man III: Worse things happens to see, you know.

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucifixioned Man III: I mean, what have you got to lose? You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing,
what have you lost? Nothing!

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III: Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III: Cheer up, you old bugger! Come on! Give us a grin! There you are! See? The end of the film. Incidentally,
this record is available in the forehands.

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III: Summer's got to live as well, you know? Who do you think pays for all this rubbish?

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
always look on the right side of life,

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Crucified Man III: They're not gonna make their money back, you know. I told them. I said to them. Bernie, I said they'll
never make their money back.

Crucified Man III & Crucifixion Party:
Always look on the right side of life...

Crucifixion Party: [Whistle]

Why are we here, what is life all about?
Is God really real, or is there some doubt?
Well tonight we're going to sort it all out,
For tonight it's the Meaning of Life.

What's the point of all these hoax?
Is it the chicken and egg time, are we all just yolks?
Or perhaps, we're just one of God's little jokes,
Well ca c'est the Meaning of Life.

Is life just a game where we make up the rules
While we're searching for something to say
Or are we just simple spiralling coils
Of self-replicating DNA?

What is life?  What is our fate?
Is there Heaven and Hell?  Do we reincarnate?
Is mankind evolving or is it too late?
Well tonight here's the Meaning of Life.

For millions this life is a sad vale of tears
Sitting round with really nothing to say
While scientists say we're just simply spiralling coils
Of self-replicating DNA.

So just why, why are we here?
And just what, what, what, what do we fear?
Well ce soir, for a change, it will all be made clear,
For this is the Meaning of Life - c'est le sens de la vie -
This is the Meaning of Life.

                      THE MEANING OF LIFE
                      -------------------

                            PART I

                     THE MIRACLE OF BIRTH

[Hospital corridor. A mother-to-be is being wheeled very fast down
the corridor on a trolley, which crashes through several sets of
doors. A nurse with her slips into a consultant's room, where one
doctor is throwing beer mats through the crooked arm of another.]

First Doctor: One thousand and eight!

Nurse: Mrs Moore's contractions are more frequent, doctor.

First Doctor: Good. Take her into the foetus-frightening room.

Nurse: Right.

         [They pass through the delivery room.]

First Doctor: Bit bare in here today. isn't it?

Second Doctor: Yeees.

First Doctor: More apparatus please, nurse.

Nurse: Yes doctor.

First Doctor: Yes, the EEG, the BP monitor and the AVV, please.

Second Doctor: And get the machine that goes 'Ping'!

First Doctor: And get the most expensive machines in case the
    administrator comes.

         [Apparatus starts pouring into the room. The mother is
         lost behind various bits of equipment.]

First Doctor: That's better, that's much better.

Second Doctor: Yeeees. More like it.

First Doctor: Still something missing, though. [They think hard for
    a few moments.]

First and Second Doctors: Patient?

Second Doctor: Where's the patient?

First Doctor: Anyone seen the patient?

Second Doctor: Patient!

Nurse: Ah, here she is.

First Doctor: Bring her round.

Second Doctor: Mind the machine!

First Doctor: Come along!

Second Doctor: Jump up there. Hup!

First Doctor: Hallo! Now, don't you worry.

Second Doctor: We'll soon have you cured.

First Doctor: Leave it all to us, you'll never know what hit you.

First and Second Doctors: Goodbye, goodbye! Drips up! Injections.

Second Doctor: Can I put the tube in the baby's head?

First Doctor: Only if I can do the epesiotomy.

Second Doctor: Okay.

First Doctor: Now, legs up.

         [The legs are put in the stirrups, while the Doctors open
         the doors opposite.]

First and Second Doctors: Come on. Come on, all of you. That's it,
    jolly good. Come on. Come on. Spread round there.

         [A small horde enters, largely medical but with two
         Japanese with cameras and video equipment. The first
         doctor bumps into a man.]

First Doctor: Who are you?

Man: I'm the husband.

First Doctor: I'm sorry. only people involved are allowed in here.

         [The husband leaves.]

Mrs Moore: What do I do?

Second Doctor: Yes?

Mrs Moore: What's that for?

         [She points to a machine.]

First Doctor: That's the machine that goes 'Ping'!

         [It goes 'Ping'.]

First Doctor: You see. It means that your baby is still alive.

Second Doctor: And that's the most expensive machine in the whole
    hospital.

First Doctor: Yes, it cost over three quarters of a million pounds.

Second Doctor: Aren't you lucky!

Nurse: The administrator's here, doctor.

First Doctor: Switch everything on!

         [They do so. Everything flashes and beeps and thuds.
         Enter the administrator...]

Administrator: Morning, gentlemen.

First and Second Doctors: Morning Mr Pycroft.

Administrator: Very impressive. What are you doing this morning?

First Doctor: It's a birth.

Administrator: And what sort of thing is that?

Second Doctor: Well, that's when we take a new baby out of a lady's
    tummy.

Administrator: Wonderful what we can do nowadays. Ah! I see you
    have the machine that goes 'Ping'. This is my favourite. You
    see we lease this back to the company we sold it to. That
    way it comes under the monthly current budget and not the
    capital account. [They all applaud.] Thank you, thank you. We
    try to do our best. Well, do carry on.

         [He leaves.]

Nurse: Oh, the vulva's dilating, doctor.

First Doctor: Yes, there's the head. Yes, four centimetres, five,
    six centimetres...

First and Second Doctors: Lights! Amplify the ping machine. Masks
    up! Suction! Eyes down for a full house! Here it comes!

         [The baby arrives.]

First Doctor: And frighten it!

         [They grab the baby, hold it upside down, slap it, poke
         tubes up its nose, hose it with cold water. Then the baby
         is placed on a wooden chopping block and the umbilicus
         severed with a chopper.]

    And the rough towels!

         [It is dried with rough towels.]

    Show it to the mother.

         [It is shown to the mother.]

First and Second Doctors: That's enough! Right. Sedate her, number
    the child. Measure it, blood type it and... *isolate* it.

Nurse: OK, show's over.

Mrs Moore: Is it a boy or a girl?

First Doctor: Now I think it's a little early to start imposing
    roles on it, don't you? Now a world of advice. You may find
    that you suffer for some time a totally irrational feeling of
    depression. PND is what we doctors call it. So it's lots of
    happy pills for you, and you can find out all about the birth
    when you get home. It's available on Betamax, VHS and Super 8.

                      -------------------

                     THE MIRACLE OF BIRTH

                            PART 2

                        THE THIRD WORLD

                           Yorkshire

[A northern street. Dad is marching home. We see his house. A stork
flies above it, and drops a baby down the chimney.]

Dad: Oh bloody hell.

         [Inside the house. A pregnant woman is at the sink. With
         a cry a new-born baby, complete with umbilical cord,
         drops from between her legs onto the floor.]

Mother: Get that would you, Deirdre...

Girl: All right, Mum.

         [The girl takes the baby. Mum carries on.]

         [Dad comes up to the door and pushes it open sadly.
         Inside there are at least forty children, of various
         ages, packed into the living room.]

Mum: [with tray] Whose teatime is it?

Scores of Voices: Me, mum...

Mum: Vincent, Tessa, Valerie, Janine, Martha, Andrew, Thomas,
    Walter, Pat, Linda, Michael, Evadne, Alice, Dominique, and
    Sasha... it's your bedtime!

Children: [all together] Oh, Mum!

Mum: Don't argue...  Laura, Alfred, Nigel, Annie, Simon, Amanda...

Dad: Wait...

         [They all listen.]

    I've got something to tell the whole family.

         [All stop... A buzz of excitement.]

Mum: [to her nearest son] Quick... go and get the others in,
    Gordon!

         [Gordon goes out.  Another twenty or so children enter
         the room.  They squash in at the back as best they can.]

Dad: The mill's closed. There's no more work, we're destitute.

         [Lots of cries of 'Oh no!'... 'Cripes'... 'Heck'... from
         around the room.]

    I've got no option but to sell you all for scientific
    experiments. [The children protest with heart-rending pleas.]
    No no, that's the way it is my loves... Blame the Catholic
    church for not letting me wear one of those little rubber
    things... Oh they've done some wonderful things in their time,
    they preserved the might and majesty, even the mystery of the
    Church of Rome, the sanctity of the sacrament and the
    indivisible oneness of the Trinity, but if they'd let me wear
    one of the little rubber things on the end of my cock we
    wouldn't be in the mess we are now.

Little Boy: Couldn't Mummy have worn some sort of pessary?

Dad: Not if we're going to remain members of the fastest growing
    religion in the world, my boy... You see, we believe... well,
    let me put it like this...
    [sings]

    There are Jews in the world,
    There are Buddhists,
    There are Hindus and Mormons and then,
    There are those that follow Mohammed,
    But I've never been one of them...

    I'm a Roman Catholic,
    And have been since before I was born,
    And the one thing they say about Catholics,
    Is they'll take you as soon as you're warm...

    You don't have to be a six-footer,
    You don't have to have a great brain,
    You don't have to have any clothes on -
    You're a Catholic the minute Dad came...

    Because...

    Every sperm is sacred,
    Every sperm is great,
    If a sperm is wasted,
    God gets quite irate.

Children: Every sperm is sacred,
    Every sperm is great,
    If a sperm is wasted,
    God gets quite irate.

Child: [solo] Let the heathen spill theirs,
    On the dusty ground,
    God shall make them pay for,
    Each sperm that can't be found.

Children: Every sperm is wanted,
    Every sperm is good,
    Every sperm is needed,
    In your neighbourhood.

Mum: [solo] Hindu, Taoist, Mormon,
    Spill theirs just anywhere,
    But God loves those who treat their
    Semen with more care.

Men neighbours: [peering out of toilets]
    Every sperm is sacred,
    Every sperm is great,

Women neighbours: [on wall]
    If a sperm is wasted,

Children: God get quite irate.

Priest: [in church] Every sperm is sacred,

Bride and Groom: Every sperm is good.

Nannies: Every sperm is needed.

Cardinals: [in prams] In your neighbourhood!

Children: Every sperm is useful,
    Every sperm is fine,

Funeral Cortege: God needs everybody's,

First Mourner: Mine!

Lady Mourner: And mine!

Corpse: And mine!

Nun: [solo] Though the pagans spill theirs,
    O'er mountain, hill and plain,

Various artefacts in a Roman Catholic Souvenir Shop:
    God shall strike them down for
    Each sperm that's spilt in vain.

Everybody: Every sperm is sacred,
    Every sperm is good,
    Every sperm is needed,
    In your neighbourhood.

Even more than everybody, including two fire-eaters, a juggler, a
clown at a piano and a stilt-walker riding a bicycle:
    Every sperm is sacred,
    Every sperm is great,
    If a sperm is wasted,
    God gets quite irate.

         [Everybody cheers (including the fire-eaters, the
         juggler, the clown at the piano and the stilt-walker
         riding the bicycle). Fireworks go off, a Chinese dragon
         is brought on and flags of all nations are unfurled
         overhead.]

         [Back inside.]

Dad: So you see my problem, little ones... I can't keep you here
    any longer.

Shout from the back: Speak up!

Dad: [raising his voice] I can't keep you here any longer... God
    has blessed us so much that I can't afford to feed you
    anymore.

Boy: Couldn't you have your balls cut off...?

Dad: It's not as simple as that Nigel... God knows all... He would
    see through such a cheap trick. What we do to ourselves, we do
    to Him...

Voice: You could have them pulled off in an accident?

         [Other voices suggest ways his balls can be removed.]

Dad: No... no... children... I know you're trying to help but
    believe me, my mind's made up. I've given this long and
    careful thought. And it's medical experiments for the lot of
    you...

         [The children emerge singing a melancholy reprise of
         'Every Sperm is Sacred.']

         [They are being watched from another Northern house.]

Mr Blackitt: Look at them, bloody Catholics. Filling the bloody
    world up with bloody people they can't afford to bloody feed.

Mrs Blackitt: What are we dear?

Mr Blackitt: Protestant, and fiercely proud of it...

Mrs Blackitt: Why do they have so many children...?

Mr Blackitt: Because every time they have sexual intercourse they
    have to have a baby.

Mrs Blackitt: But it's the same with us, Harry.

Mr Blackitt: What d'you mean...?

Mrs Blackitt: Well I mean we've got two children and we've had
    sexual intercourse twice.

Mr Blackitt: That's not the point... We *could* have it any time we
    wanted.

Mrs Blackitt: Really?

Mr Blackitt: Oh yes. And, what's more, because we don't believe in
    all that Papist claptrap we can take precautions.

Mrs Blackitt: What, you mean lock the door...?

Mr Blackitt: No no, I mean, because we are members of the
    Protestant Reformed Church which successfully challenged the
    autocratic power of the Papacy in the mid-sixteenth century,
    we can wear 
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 11584 --]
little rubber devices to prevent issue.

Mrs Blackitt: What do you mean?

Mr Blackitt: I could, if I wanted, have sexual intercourse with
    you...

Mrs Blackitt: Oh, yes... Harry...

Mr Blackitt: And by wearing a rubber sheath over my old feller I
    could ensure that when I came off... you would not be
    impregnated.

Mrs Blackitt: Ooh!

Mr Blackitt: That's what being a Protestant's all about. That's
    why it's the church for me. That's why it's the church for
    anyone who respects the  individual and the individual's right
    to decide for him or herself. When Martin Luther nailed his
    protest up to the church door in 1517, he may not have
    realised the full significance of what he was doing. But four
    hundred years later, thanks to him, my dear, I can wear
    whatever I want on my John Thomas. And Protestantism doesn't
    stop at the simple condom. Oh no! I can wear French Ticklers
    if I want.

Mrs Blackitt: You what?

Mr Blackitt: French Ticklers... Black Mambos... Crocodile Ribs...
    Sheaths that are designed not only to protect but also to
    enhance the stimulation of sexual congress...

Mrs Blackitt: Have you got one?

Mr Blackitt: Have I got one? Well no... But I can go down the road
    any time I want and walk into Harry's and hold my head up
    high, and say in a loud steady voice: 'Harry I want you to
    sell me a *condom*. In fact today I think I'll have a French
    Tickler, for I am a Protestant...'

Mrs Blackitt: Well why don't you?

Mr Blackitt: But they... [He points at the stream of children still
    pouring past the house.]... they cannot. Because their church
    never made the great leap out of the Middle Ages, and the
    domination of alien episcopal supremacy!

                            LUTHER
                              in

                        Reform-O-Scope

                         presented by
              The Protestant Film Marketing Board
                      in association with
                Sol. C. Ziegler, Andy Rotbeiner

                            GERMANY
                in the grip of the 16th century

An exciting and controversial examination of the Protestant
reformer whose re-assessment of the role of the individual in
Christian belief shook the foundations of a post-feudal Germany in
the grip of the sixteenth century.

It was a day much like any other in the quiet little town of
Wittenberg. Mamie Meyer was preparing fat for the evening meal when
the full force of the Reformation struck.

         [A woman and two rather plain daughters are sitting
         outside their house with bowls. A man arrives
         breathless.]

Hymie: Mamie! Martin Luther's out!

         [Consternation amongst the womenfolk.]

Mamie: Oh! Martin Luther!

         [She hurries her daughters inside.]

    Did you get the suet, Hymie?

Hymie: Oy vay - the suet I clean forgot!

Mamie: The suet you forgot!

Hymie: The lard, the fish oil, the butter fat, the dripping, the
    wool grease I remember... [Hands over the shopping]... but the
    suet... oy vay...

Mamie: [pointing to his head] So what'd keep up there? Adipose
    tissue?

Hymie: Look out! Here he comes.

         [Mamie goes inside shouting.]

Mamie: Girls, girls! Your father forgot the suet!

         [Groans from the girls inside.]

         [Martin Luther is at the gate. His ears prick up at the
         female voices. His eyes flick from side to side.]

Hymie: Hallo Martin.

Martin Luther: Where's the john?

Hymie: We don't have one.

Martin Luther: No john? What d'you do?

Hymie: We eat fat.

Martin Luther: And that stops you going to the john?

Hymie: It's a theory.

Martin Luther: Yeah, but does it work?

Hymie: We ain't got no john.

Martin Luther: Yeah, but d'you need to go?

Hymie: You know how it is with theories - some days it's fine...
    maybe one, two... three days... and then just when it looks
    like you're ready for to publish... [Expression of resignation
    and disgust.]... Whoosh! You need a new kitchen floor.

Martin Luther: Oh you should be so lucky!

         [A girl's laugh from inside. Martin Luther looks up -
         alert.]

Martin Luther: D'you need any cleaning inside?

Hymie: Oh no... today it's all going fine.

Martin Luther: Oh well, how's about showing me the cutlery?

Hymie: Martin - I got a woman and children in there.

Martin Luther: So there's no problem... I just look at a few
    spoons... and...

         [Martin Luther starts to go in. Hymie stops him.]

Hymie: I got two girls in there, Martin... you know what I mean.

Martin Luther: Honest! I don't look at your girls! I don't even
    think about them! There! I put them out of my mind! Their
    arms, their necks... their little legs... and bosoms... I
    *wipe* from my mind.

Hymie: You just want to see spoons?

Martin Luther: My life! That's what I want to see.

Hymie: I know I'm going to regret this.

Martin Luther: No, listen! Cutlery is really my thing now. Girls
    with round breasts is over for me.

Hymie: What am I doing? I know what's going to happen.

Martin Luther: I'll crouch behind you.

         [He goes in. Martin Luther follows, crouching.]

Hymie: Mamie! Guess who's come to see us!

Mamie: Hymie! Are you out of your mind already? You know how old
    your daughters are?

Hymie: He only wants to see the spoons.

Mamie: What you have to bring him into my house for?

Hymie: Mamie, he doesn't even think about girls any more.

Martin Luther: Mrs Meyer - as far as girls is concerned, I shot my
    wad!

Mamie: You shot your *wad*?

Martin Luther: Def - in - ately...

         [Pause.]

Mamie: Which spoons you wanna view?

Martin Luther: Eh... [shrugs]... I guess the soup spoons...

Mamie: [suddenly interested] Ah! Now they're good spoons.

Martin Luther: You got them arranged?

Mamie: No, but I could arrange them for you.

Martin Luther: Don't put yourself to no bother, Mrs Meyer.

Mamie: It's no bother... I want for you to see those spoons like I
    would want to see them myself.

Martin Luther: Oh you're too kind, Mrs Meyer... You could get your
    daughters to show me them...

Mamie: Hymie get him out of here.

Hymie: Mamie, he only said for Myrtle and Audrey to show him the
    *spoons*.

Mamie: Like you think I run some kind of bordello here...

Martin Luther: Mrs Meyer! How can you say such a thing?

Mamie: Listen Martin Luther! I know what you want to do with my
    girls!

Martin Luther: Show me the spoons...

Mamie: You want for them to pull up their shirts and then lean over
    the chair with their legs apart...

Hymie: Mamie don't get excited...

Mamie: I'm getting excited? It's him that's getting excited!

Martin Luther: My mind is on the spoons.

Mamie: But you can't stop thinking of those little girls over the
    chairs.

         [Luther is struggling with himself.]

Hymie: I got to go to the bathroom.

Mamie: [grabs him] Hymie! I'm a married woman!

Hymie: So... just show him the spoons.

         [Hymie goes.]

Mamie: And you don't want to put nothing up me?

Martin Luther: Mrs Meyer - you read my mind.

Mamie: Oh...

         [They go out discreetly.]

But despite the efforts of Protestants to promote the idea of sex
for pleasure, children continued to multiply everywhere.

                      THE MEANING OF LIFE
                      -------------------

                            PART II

                      GROWTH AND LEARNING

[A school chapel.]

Headmaster: And spotteth twice they the camels before the third
    hour. And so the Midianites went forth to Ram Gilead in Kadesh
    Bilgemath by Shor Ethra Regalion, to the house of
    Gash-Bil-Betheul-Bazda, he who brought the butter dish to
    Balshazar and the tent peg to the house of Rashomon, and there
    slew they the goats, yea, and placed they the bits in little
    pots. Here endeth the lesson.

         [The Headmaster closes the Bible. the Chaplain rises.]

Chaplain: Let us praise God. Oh Lord...

Congregation: Oh Lord...

Chaplain: Oooh you are so big...

Congregation: Oooh you are so big...

Chaplain: So absolutely huge.

Congregation: So ab - solutely huge.

Chaplain: Gosh, we're all really impressed down here I can tell
    you.

Congregation: Gosh, we're all really impressed down here I can tell
    you.

Chaplain: Forgive Us, O Lord, for this dreadful toadying.

Congregation: And barefaced flattery.

Chaplain: But you are so strong and, well, just so super.

Congregation: Fan - tastic.

Headmaster: Amen. Now two boys have been found rubbing linseed oil
    into the school cormorant. Now some of you may feel that the
    cormorant does not play an important part in the life of the
    school but I remind you that it was presented to us by the
    Corporation of the town of Sudbury to commemorate Empire Day,
    when we try to remember the names of all those from the
    Sudbury area so gallantly gave their lives to keep China
    British. So from now on the cormorant is strictly out of
    bounds. Oh... and Jenkins... apparently your mother died this
    morning. [He turns to the Chaplain.] Chaplain.

         [The congregation rises and the Chaplain leads them in
         singing.]

Chaplain and Congregation:
    Oh Lord, please don't burn us,
    Don't grill or toast your flock,
    Don't put us on the barbecue,
    Or simmer us in stock,
    Don't braise or bake or boil us,
    Or stir-fry us in a wok...

    Oh please don't lightly poach us,
    Or baste us with hot fat,
    Don't fricassee or roast us,
    Or boil us in a vat,
    And please don't stick thy servants Lord,
    In a Rotissomat...

         [A classroom. The boys are sitting quietly studying.]

Boy: He's coming!

         [Pandemonium breaks out. The Headmaster walks in.]

Headmaster: All right, settle down, settle down. [He puts his
    papers down.] Now before I begin the lesson will those of you
    who are playing in the match this afternoon move your clothes
    down on to the lower peg immediately after lunch before you
    write your letter home, if you're not getting your hair cut,
    unless you've got a younger brother who is going out this
    weekend as the guest of another boy, in which case collect his
    note before lunch, put it in your letter after you've had your
    hair cut, and make sure he moves your clothes down onto the
    lower peg for you. Now...

Wymer: Sir?

Headmaster: Yes, Wymer?

Wymer: My younger brother's going out with Dibble this weekend,
    sir, but I'm not having my hair cut today sir, so do I move my
    clothes down or...

Headmaster: I do wish you'd listen, Wymer, it's perfectly simple.
    If you're not getting your hair cut, you don't have to move
    your brother's clothes down to the lower peg, you simply
    collect his note before lunch after you've done your scripture
    prep when you've written your letter home before rest, move
    your own clothes on to the lower peg, greet the visitors, and
    report to Mr Viney that you've had your chit signed. Now,
    sex... sex, sex, sex, where were we?

         [Silence from form. A lot of hard thinking of the type
         indulged by schoolboys who know they don't know the
         answer.]

    Well, had I got as far as the penis entering the vagina?

Pupils: Er... er... no sir. No we didn't, sir.

Headmaster: Well had I done foreplay?

Pupils: ...Yes sir.

Headmaster: Well, as we all know about foreplay no doubt you can
    tell me what the purpose of f
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 16384 --]
oreplay is... Biggs.

Biggs: Don't know, sorry sir.

Headmaster: Carter.

Carter: Er... was it taking your clothes off, sir?

Headmaster: And after that?

Wymer: Putting them on the lower peg sir?

         [Headmaster throws a board duster at him and hits him.]

Headmaster: The purpose of foreplay is to cause the vagina to
    lubricate so that the penis can penetrate more easily.

Watson: Could we have a window open please sir?

Headmaster: Yes... Harris will you?... And, of course, to cause the
    man's penis to erect and har...den. Now, did I do vaginal
    juices last week oh do pay attention Wadsworth, I know it's
    Friday afternoon oh watching the football are you boy - right
    move over there. I'm warning you I may decide to set an
    exam this term.

Pupils: Oh sir...

Headmaster: So just listen... now did I or did I not do vaginal
    juices?

Pupils: Yes sir.

Headmaster: Name two ways of getting them flowing, Watson.

Watson: Rubbing the clitoris, sir.

Headmaster: What's wrong with a kiss, boy? Hm? Why not start her
    off with a nice kiss? You don't have to go leaping straight
    for the clitoris like a bull at a gate. Give her a kiss, boy.

Wymer: Suck the nipple, sir.

Headmaster: Good. Good. Good, well done, Wymer.

Duckworth: Stroking the thighs, sir.

Headmaster: Yes, I suppose so.

Another: Bite the neck.

Headmaster: Good. Nibbling the ear. Kneading the buttocks, and so
    on and so forth. So we have all these possibilities before we
    stampede towards the clitoris, Watson.

Watson: Yes sir. Sorry sir.

Headmaster: All these form of stimulation can now take place.

         [The Headmaster pulls the bed down.]

    ... And of course tongueing will give you the best idea of how
    the juices are coming along. [Calls.] Helen... Now penetration
    and coitus, that is to say intercourse up to and including
    orgasm.

         [Mrs Williams has entered.]

    Ah hallo, dear.

         [The pupils have shuffled more or less to their feet.]

    *Do* stand up when my wife enters the room, Carter.

Carter: Oh sorry, sir. Sorry.

Mrs Williams: Humphrey, I hope you don't mind, but I told the
    Garfields we *would* dine with them tonight.

Headmaster: [starting to disrobe] Yes, yes, I suppose we must...

Mrs Williams: [taking off her clothes] I said we'd be there by
    eight.

Headmaster: Well at least it'll give me a reason to wind up the
    staff meeting.

Mrs Williams: Well I know you don't like them but I couldn't make
    another excuse.

Headmaster: [he's got his shirt off] Well it's just that I felt -
    Wymer. This is for your benefit. Will you kindly wake up. I've
    no intention of going through this all again. [The boys are no
    more interested than they were in the last lesson on the
    Binomial Theorem, though they pretend, as usual.] Now we'll
    take the foreplay as read, if you don't mind, dear.

Mrs Williams: No of course not, Humphrey.

Headmaster: So the man starts by entering, or mounting his good
    lady wife in the standard way. The penis is now as you will
    observe more or less fully erect. There we are. Ah that's
    better. Now... Carter.

Carter: Yes sir.

Headmaster: What is it?

Carter: It's an ocarina... sir.

Headmaster: Bring it up here. The man now starts making thrusting
    movements with his pelvic area, moving the penis up and down
    inside the vagina so... put it there boy, put it there... on
    the table... while the wife maximizes her clitoral stimulation
    by the shaft of the penis by pushing forward, thank you
    dear... now as sexual excitement mounts... what's funny Biggs?

Biggs: Oh, nothing sir.

Headmaster: Oh do please share your little joke with the rest of
    us... I mean, obviously something frightfully funny's going
    on...

Biggs: No, honestly, sir.

Headmaster: Well as it's so funny I think you'd better be selected
    to play for the boys' team in the rugby match against the
    masters this afternoon.

Biggs: [looks horrified] Oh no, sir.

                      THE MEANING OF LIFE
                      -------------------

                           PART III

                      FIGHTING EACH OTHER

Biggs: [now a soldiers-in-arms] O.K. Blackitt, Sturridge and
    Walters you take the buggers on the left flank. Hordern,
    Spadger and I will go for the gunpost.

Blackitt: [a Deptford Cockney] Hang on, you'll never make it,
    sir... Let us come with you...

Biggs: Do as you're told man.

Blackitt: Righto, skipper. [He starts to go, then stops.] Oh, sir,
    sir... if we... if we don't meet again... sir, I'd just like
    to say it's been a real privilege fighting alongside you,
    sir...

         [They are continually ducking as bullets fly past them
         and shells burst overhead.]

Biggs: Yes, well I think this is hardly the time or place for a
    goodbye speech... eh...

         [Biggs is clearly anxious to go.]

Blackitt: No, me, and the lads realise that but... well... we may
    never meet again, sir, so...

Biggs: All right, Blackitt, thanks a lot.

Blackitt: No just a mo, sir! You see me and the lads had a little
    whip-round, sir, and we bought you something, sir... we bought
    you this, sir...

         [He produces a handsome ormolu clock from his pack. Biggs
         is at a loss for words. He is continually ducking.]

Biggs: Well, I don't know what to say... It's a lovely thought...
    thank you... thank you *all*... but I think we'd better... get
    to cover now...

         [He starts to go.]

Blackitt: Hang on a tick, sir, we got something else for you as
    well, sir.

         [Two of the others emerge from some bushes with a
         grandfather clock.]

    Sorry it's another clock, sir... only there was a bit of a
    mix-up... Walters thought *he* was buying the present, and
    Spadger and I had already got the other one.

Biggs: Well it's beautiful... they're both beau -

         [A bullet suddenly shatters the face of the grandfather
         clock.]

    ... But I think we'd better get to cover now, and I'll thank
    you properly later...

         [Biggs starts to go again but Blackitt hasn't finished.]

Blackitt: And Corporal Sturridge got this for you as well, sir. He
    didn't know about the others, sir - it's Swiss.

         [He hands over a wristwatch.]

Biggs: Well now that is thoughtful, Sturridge. Good man.

         [A shell bursts right overhead. Biggs flings himself down
         into the mud.]

Blackitt: And there's a card, sir... from all of us... [He produces
    a blood-splattered envelope.]... Sorry about the blood, sir.

Biggs: Thank you all.

         [He pockets it and tries to go on.]

Blackitt: Squad, three cheers for Captain Biggs. Hip Hip -

All: Hooray!

Blackitt: Hip Hip -

All: Hoor...

         [An almighty burst of machine-gun fire silences most of
         them... Blackitt is hit.]

Biggs: Blackitt! Blackitt!

Blackitt: [hurt] Ah! I'll be all right, sir... Oh there's just one
    other thing, sir. Spadge, give him the cheque...

Spadger: Oh yeah...

Biggs: Oh now this is really going to far...

Spadger: I don't seem to be able to find it, sir... [Explosion.]
    Er, it'll be in Number Four trench... I'll go and get it. [He
    starts to crawl off.]

Biggs: [losing his cool] Oh! For Christ's sake forget it, man.

         [The others all look at Biggs after this outburst, as if
         they can't believe this ingratitude.]

Blackitt: Oh! Ah!

Spadger: You shouldn't have said that, sir. You've hurt his
    feelings now...

Blackitt: Don't mind me, Spadge... Toffs is all the same... One
    minute it's all 'please' and 'thank you', the next they'll
    kick you in the teeth...

Walters: Let's not give him the cake...

Biggs: I don't want *any* cake...

Spadger: Look, Blackitt cooked it specially for you, you bastard.

         [They all look at Blackitt rolling in the mud.]

Sturridge: Yeah, he saved his rations for six weeks.

Biggs: I'm sorry, I don't mean to be ungrateful...

Blackitt: I'll be all right.

         [Shell crashes. Blackitt dies.]

Spadger: Blackie! Blackie! [He turns to Biggs with tears in his
    eyes.] Look at him... [He pulls up the supine form of
    Blackitt.] He worked on that cake like no-one else I've ever
    known. [He props him in the mud again.] Some nights it was so
    cold we could hardly move, but Blackie'd de out there -
    slicing lemons, mixing the sugar and the almonds... I mean you
    try getting butter melted at fifteen below zero! There's love
    in that cake... [He picks up Blackitt again.] This man's love
    and this man's care and this man's - Aarggh!
    [He gets shot.]

    [Biggs runs over to them in horror.]

Biggs: Oh my Christ!

Sturridge: You bastard.

Biggs: All right! All right! We will eat the cake. They're right...
    it's too good a cake not to eat. get the plates and knives,
    Walters...

Walters: Yes, sir... how many plates?

Biggs: Six.

         [A shot rings out. Walters drops dead.]

Biggs: Er... no... better make it five.

Sturridge: Tablecloth, sir...?

Biggs: Yes, get the tablecloth...!

         [Explosion. Sturridge gets shot.]

Biggs: No no no, I'll get the tablecloth and you'd better get the
    gate-leg table, Hordern.

         [Hordern is shot in the leg.]

Hordern: I'll bring two sir, in case one gets scrumpled...

         [Suddenly we find this has all been a film, which a
         General now stops.]

General: Well, of course, warfare isn't all fun. Right, stop that.
    It's all very well to laugh at the Military, but when one
    considers the meaning of life it is a struggle between
    alternative viewpoints of life itself. And without the
    ability to defend one's own viewpoint against other perhaps
    more aggressive ideologies then reasonableness and moderation
    could quite simply disappear. That is why we'll always need an
    army and may God strike me down were it to be otherwise.

         [The Hand of god descends and vaporizes him.]

         [The audience of two old ladies and two kids applauds
         hesitantly.]

         [Outside the hut RSM Whateverhisnameis is drilling a
         small squad of recruits.]

RSM: Don't stand there gawping like you've never seen the Hand of
    God before. Now! Today we're going to do marching up and down
    the square. That is unless any of you got anything better to
    do? Well, anyone got anything they'd rather be doing than
    marching up and down the square?

         [Atkinson puts his hand up.]

    Yes? Atkinson? What would you rather be doing, Atkinson?

Atkinson: Well to be quite honest, Sarge, I'd rather be at home
    with the wife and kids.

RSM: Would you now?

Atkinson: Yes, sarge.

RSM: Right off you go. [Atkinson goes.] Now, everybody else happy
    with my little plan of marching up and down the square a bit?

Coles: Sarge...

RSM: Yes?

Coles: I've got a book I'd quite like to read...

RSM: Right! You go read your book then! [Coles runs off.] Now
    everybody else quite content to join in with my little scheme
    of marching hup and down the square?

Wycliff: Sarge?

RSM: Yes, Wycliff, what is it?

Wycliff: [tentatively] Well... I'm... er... learning the piano...

RSM: [with contempt] 'Learning the piano'?

Wycliff: Yes, sarge...

RSM: And I suppose you want to go and practise eh? Marching up and
    down the square not good enough for you, eh?

Wycliff: Well...

RSM: Right! Off you go! [Turns to the rest.] Now what about the
    rest of you? Rather be at the pictures I suppose.

Squad: Ooh, yes, ooh rather.

RSM: All right off you go. [They go.] Bloody army! I don't know
    what it's coming to... Right, Sgt Major, marching up and down
    the square... Left-right-left... left... left...
    left-right-left...

         [The RSM marches himself off into the distance of the
         barracks square.]

Democracy and humanitarianism have always been tarde marks of the
British Army and have stamped its triumph throughout history, in
the furthest-flung corners of the Empire. But no matter where or
when there was fighting to be done, it has always been the calm
leadership of the officer class that has made the British Army what
it is.

                      The First Zulu War.

                   Natal 1879 (not Glasgow)

         [Inside a tent.]

Pakenham-Walsh: Morning Ainsworth.

Ainsworth: Morning Pakenham-Walsh.

Pakenham-Walsh: Sleep well?

Ainsworth: Not bad. Bitten to shreds though. Must be a hole in the
    bloody mosquito net.

Pakenham-Walsh: Yes, savage little blighters aren't they?

First Lieut Chadwick: [arriving] Excuse me, sir.

Ainsworth: Yes Chadwick?

Chadwick: I'm afraid Perkins got rather badly bitten during the
    night.

Ainsworth: Well so did we. Huh.

Chadwick: Yes, but I do think the doctor ought to see him.

Ainsworth: Well go and fetch him, then.

Chadwick: Right you are, sir.

Ainsworth: Suppose I'd better go along. Coming, Pakenham?

Pakenham-Walsh: Yes I suppose so.

         [Chadwick leaves. Ainsworth and Pakenham-Walsh thread
         their leisurely way through the line of assegais.
         Pakenham-Walsh's valet is speared by a Zulu warrior but
         Pakenham-Walsh valiantly saves his jacket from the mud.
         They enter Perkins's tent. Perkins is on his camp bed.]

Ainsworth: Ah! Morning Perkins.

Perkins: Morning sir.

Ainsworth: What's all the trouble then?

Perkins: Bitten sir. During the night.

Ainsworth: Hm. Whole leg gone eh?

Perkins: Yes.

         [As they talk, the din of battle continues outside.
         Screams of dying men, crackling of tents set on fire.]

Ainsworth: How's it feel?

Perkins: Stings a bit.

Ainsworth: Mmm. Well it would, wouldn't it. That's quite a bite
    you've got there you know.

Perkins: Yes, real beauty isn't it?

All: Yes.

Ainsworth: Any idea how it happened?

Perkins: None at all. Complete mystery to me. Woke up just now...
    one sock too many.

Pakenham-Walsh: You must have a hell of a hole in your net.

Ainsworth: Hm. We've sent for the doctor.

Perkins: Ooh, hardly worth it, is it?

Ainsworth: Oh yes... better safe than sorry.

Pakenham-Walsh: Yes, good Lord, look at this.

         [He indicates a gigantic hole in the mosquito net.]

Ainsworth: By jove, that's enormous.

Pakenham-Walsh: You don't think it'll come back, do you?

Ainsworth: For more, you mean?

Pakenham-Walsh: Yes.

Ainsworth: You're right. We'd better get this stitched.

Pakenham-Walsh: Right.

Ainsworth: Hallo Doc.

Livingstone: [entering the tent with Chadwick] Morning. I came as
    fast as I could. Is something up?

Ainsworth: Yes, during the night old Perkins had his leg bitten
    sort of... off.

Livingstone: Ah hah!? Been in the wars have we?

Perkins: Yes.

Livingstone: Any headache, bowels all right? Well, let's have a
    look at this one leg of yours then. [Looks around under sheet]
    Yes... yes... yes... yes... yes... yes... well, this is
    nothing to worry about.

Perkins: Oh good.

Livingstone: There's a lot of it about, probably a virus, keep
    warm, plenty of rest, and if you're playing football or
    anything try and favour the other leg.

Perkins: Oh right ho.

Livingstone: Be as right as rain in a couple of days.

Perkins: Thanks for the reassurance, doc.

Livingstone: Not at all, that's what I'm here for. Any other
    problems I can reassure you about?

Perkins: No I'm fine.

Livingstone: Jolly good. Well, must be off.

Perkins: So it'll just grow back then, will it?

Livingstone: Er... I think I'd better come clean with you about
    this... it's... um it's not a virus, I'm afraid. You see, a
    virus is what we doctors call very very small. So small it
    could not possibly have made off with a whole leg. What we're
    looking for here is I think, and this is no more than an
    educated guess, I'd like to make that clear, is some
    multi-cellular life form with stripes, huge razor-sharp teeth,
    about eleven foot long and of the genu *felis horribilis*.
    What we doctors, in fact, call a tiger.

All in tent: A tiger...!!

         [Outside, everyone engaged in battle, including the
         Zulus, breaks off and shouts in horror:]

All: A tiger!

         [The Zulus run off.]

Pakenham-Walsh: A tiger - in Africa?

Ainsworth: Hm...

Pakenham-Walsh: A tiger in Africa...?

Ainsworth: Ah... well it's probably escaped from a zoo.

Pakenham-
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 5336 --]
Walsh: Well it doesn't sound very likely.

Ainsworth: [quietly] Stumm, stumm...

         [A severely-wounded Sergeant staggers into the tent.]

Sergeant: Sir, sir, the attack's over, sir! the Zulus are
    retreating.

Ainsworth: [dismissively] Oh jolly good. [He turns his back to the
    group around Perkins.]

Sergeant: Quite a lot of casualties though, sir. C Division wiped
    out. Signals gone. Thirty men killed in F Section. I should
    think about a hundred - a hundred and fifty men altogether.

Ainsworth: [not very interested] Yes, yes I see, yes... Jolly good.

Sergeant: I haven't got the final figures, sir. There's a lot of
    seriously wounded in the compound...

Ainsworth: [interrupting] Yes... well, the thing is, Sergeant, I've
    got a bit of a problem here. [With gravity.] One of the
    officers has lost a leg.

Sergeant: [stunned by the news] Oh *no*, sir!

Ainsworth: [gravely] I'm afraid so. Probably a tiger.

Sergeant: In Africa?

Ainsworth and Pakenham-Walsh: Stumm, stumm...

Ainsworth: The M.O. says we can stitch it back on if we find it
    immediately.

Sergeant: Right sir! I'll organise a party right away, sir!

Ainsworth: Well it's hardly time for that, is it Sergeant...?

Sergeant: A search party...

Ainsworth: Ah! *Much* better idea. I'll tell you what, organise one
    straight away.

Sergeant: Yes sir!

         [Outside dead British bodies (of the other ranks) are
         everywhere.]

Sergeant: [apologetically] Sorry about the mess, sir. We'll try and
    get it cleared up, by the time you get back.

         [They walk through the carnage. Orderlies are cheerfully
         attending to the equally cheery wounded and the only
         slightly less cheery dead.]

A dying man: [covered in blood] We showed 'em, didn't we, sir?

Ainsworth: Yes.

         [He gives a thumbs up and dies.]

Sergeant: [addressing a soldier who is giving water to a dying man]
    We've got to get a search party, leave that alone.

Another cheery cockney: [with an assegai sticking out of his chest]
    This is fun, sir, init... all this killing... bloodshed...
    bloody good fun sir, init?

Ainsworth: [abstracted] Yes... very good.

         [He waves and moves on.]

A severed head: Morning, sir!

Ainsworth: Nasty wound you've got there, Potter.

Severed head: [cheerily] Thank you very much sir!

Ainsworth: Come on private - we're making up a search party.

Another terrible casualty: Better than staying at home, eh sir! At
    home if you kill someone they arrest you. Here they give you
    a gun, and show you what to do, sir. I mean, I killed fifteen
    of those buggers sir! Now at home they'd hang me. *Here* they
    give me a fucking medal sir!

         [The search party for Perkins's leg is passing through
    thick jungle. As they emerge into a clearing they suddenly see
    a tiger's head sticking out of some bushes.]

Ainsworth: Look!

         [Their eyes follow along the bushes to where the tiger's
    tail is sticking out several yards away. For a moment it looks
    like a very long tiger.]

    My God, it's *huge*!

         [The tiger's head rises up out of the thicket with its
         paws up. The tiger's rear end backs out of the thicket
         further down.]

Rear end: Don't shoot... don't shoot. We're not a tiger. [Takes off
    head.] We were just... um...

Ainsworth: Why are you dressed as a tiger?

Rear end: Hmmm... oh... why! Why why... isn't it a lovely day
    today...?

Ainsworth: Answer the question.

Rear end: Oh we were just er...

Front end: Actually! We're dressed like this because... oh no
    that's not it.

Rear end: We did it for a lark. Part of a spree. High spirits you
    know. Simple as that.

Front end: Nothing more to it...

         [All stare.]

    Well *actually*... we're on a mission for British
    Intellingence, there's a pro-Tsarist Ashanti Chief...

Rear end: No, no.

Front end: No, no, no.

Rear end: No, no we're doing it for an advertisement...

Front end: Ah that's it, forget about the Russians. We're doing an
    advert for Tiger Brand Coffee.

Rear end: 'Tiger Brand Coffee is a real treat
    Even tigers prefer a cup of it to real meat'.

         [Pause.]

Ainsworth: Now look...

Rear end: All right, all right. we are dressed as a tiger because
    he had an auntie who did it in 1839 and this is the fiftieth
    anniversary.

Front end: No. We're doing it for a bet.

Rear end: God told us to do it.

Front end: To tell the truth, we are completely mad. we are inmates
    of a Bengali psychiatric institution and we escaped by making
    this skin out of old cereal packets...

Perkins: It doesn't matter.

Ainsworth: What?

Perkins: It doesn't matter why they're dressed as a tiger, have
    they got my leg?

Ainsworth: Good thinking. Well have you?

Rear end: Actually!

Ainsworth: Yes.

Rear end: It's because we were thinking of training as taxidermists
    and we wanted to get a feel of it from the animal's point of
    view.

Ainsworth: Be quiet. Now, look we're just asking you if you have
    got this man's leg...

Front end: A wooden leg?

Ainsworth: No, no, a proper leg. Look he was fast asleep and
    someone or something came in and removed it.

Front end: Without waking him up?

Ainsworth: Yes.

Front end: I don't believe you.

Rear end: We found the tiger skin in
[-- CHUNK OF LENGTH 10136 --]
 a bicycle shop in Cairo, and
    the owner wanted to take it down to Dar Es Salaam.

Ainsworth: Shut up. Now look, have you or have you not got his leg?

Rear end: Yes.

Front end: No. No no no.

Both: No no no no no no. Nope. No.

Ainsworth: Why did you say 'yes'?

Front end: I didn't.

Ainsworth: I'm not talking to you...

Rear end: Er... er...

Ainsworth: Right! Search the thicket.

Front end: Oh come on, I mean do we look like the sort of chaps
    who'd creep into a camp at... night, steal into someone's
    tent, anaesthetise them, tissue-type them, amputate a leg and
    run away with it?

Ainsworth: Search the thicket!

Front end: Oh *leg*! You're looking for a *leg*. Actually I think
    there is one in there somewhere. Somebody must have abandoned
    it here, knowing you were coming after it, and we stumbled
    across it actually and wondered what it was... They'll be
    miles away by now and I expect we'll have to take all the
    blame.

         [During the last exchange a native turns and leers at the
         camera, while the dialogue continues behind him. Then he
         unzips his body to reveal a fully dressed white announcer
         in dinner jacket and bow tie underneath.]

Zulu announcer: Hallo, good evening and welcome to the Middle of
    the Film.

Lady TV presenter: Hallo and welcome to the Middle of the Film. The
    moment where we take a break and invite you, the audience, to
    join us, the film-makers, in 'Find the Fish'. We're going to
    show you a scene from another film and ask you to guess where
    the fish is. But if you think you know, don't keep it to
    yourselves - YELL OUT - so that all the cinema can hear you.
    So here we are with 'Find the Fish'.

Man: I wonder where that fish has gone.

Woman: You did love it so.
    You looked after it like a son.

Man: [strangely] And it went wherever I did go.

Woman: Is it in the cupboard?

Audience: Yes! No!

Woman: Wouldn't you like to know.
    It was a lovely little fish.

Man: [strangely] And it went wherever I did go.

Man in audience: It's behind the sofa!

         [An elephant joins the man and woman.]

Woman: Where can the fish be?

Man in audience: Have you thought of the drawers in the bureau?

Woman: It is a most elusive fish.

Man: [strangely] And it went wherever I did go!

Woman: Oh fishy, fishy, fishy, fish.

Man: Fish, fish, fish, fishy oh!

Woman: Oh fishy, fishy, fishy fish.

Man: [strangely] That went wherever I did go.

         First fish: That was terrific!

                   Second fish: Great!

         Third fish: Best bit so far.

Fishes: Yeah! Absolutely... ! Terrific! Yeah!... Fantastic...
    Really great

    [Whistles 'More'... Pause.]

Fifth fish: They haven't said much about the Meaning of Life so
    far, have they...?

First fish: Well, it's been building up to it.

Second fish: Has it?

Fifth fish: yeah, I expect they'll get on to it now.

Third fish: Personally I very much doubt if they're going to say
    anything about the Meaning of Life at all.

Fourth fish: Oh, come on... they've got to say something...

Other fishes: ... Bound to... yeah... yeah...

         [They swim around a bit.]

Second fish: Not much happening at the moment, is there...?

[A hotel lobby. The lift doors open.]

[Mrs Hendy is bending down in front of Mr Hendy, doing something of
an intimate nature to his camera lens.]

Mr Hendy: Oh that's much better. Thank you honey.

Mrs Hendy: You're welcome.

Mr Hendy: It was sort of misty before. That's fine.

         [A strange girl in a crinoline steps forward. This is
         M'Lady Joeline. played by Mr Gilliam.]

Joeline: Hi! How are you?

Mr Hendy: We're just fine.

Joeline: So what kind of food you like to eat this evening?

Mr Hendy: Well we sort of like pineapples...

Mrs Hendy: Yeah anything with pineapples in is great for us...

Joeline: Well, how about the Dungeon Room?

Mr Hendy: Oh that sounds fine...

Joeline: Sure is. It's real Hawaiian food served in an authentic
    medieval English dungeon atmosphere...

[Suddenly a red hot brand sears the flesh of some poor wretch. This
is the restaurant. Dark, full of torture instruments, stocks,
Chamber of Horrors stuff.]

[They sit down. A waitress dressed in a grotesque travesty of a
Beefeater's outfit, comes up.]

Waitress: Hello, I'm Diana, I'm your waitress for tonight... Where
    are you from?

Mr and Mrs Hendy: We're from Room 259.

Mr Hendy: Where are you from?

Waitress: [pointing to kitchen] Oh I'm from the doors over there...

Mr Hendy: Oh.

Mrs Hendy: Great...

Waitress: [reaching across to the central serving table] Iced
    Water...

Mrs Hendy: Oh thank you...

Waitress: Coffee...

Mr Hendy: Than you *very* much...

Waitress: Ketchup...

Mr Hendy: Oh lovely... real nice

Waitress: T.V....?

Mr Hendy: Oh... that's fine...

Mrs Hendy: Yeah that's swell

         [The Waitress dumps a T.V. down on the table.]

Waitress: Telephone...

Mr Hendy: Er... telephone...?

Waitress: You can phone any other table in the restaurant after
    six.

Mr Hendy: Oh that's great...

Mrs Hendy: Some choice...

Mr Hendy: Yeah, right...

Waitress: O.K.... D'you want any food with your meal?

Mr Hendy: Well, what d'you have?

Waitress: Well we have things shaped like this in green or we have
    things shaped like that in brown...

Mr Hendy: What d'you think darling?

Mrs Hendy: Well it *is* our anniversary, Marvin...

Mr Hendy: Yeah... what the hell... we'll have a couple of the
    things shaped like that in brown, please...

Waitress: O.K. fine... thank you sir... [She writes]... 2 brown
    Number 259... and will you be having intercourse tonight...?

Mr Hendy: Er... do we have to decide now...?

Mrs Hendy: Sounds a good idea honey. I mean it sounds swell. I mean
    why not?

Mr Hendy: Yeah, right... could be fun...

         [Waitress takes out a condom and slaps it on the table.]

Waitress: Compliments of the Super Inn - Have a nice fuck!

Mr Hendy: Oh, thank you.

Waitress: You're welcome...

         [She leaves.]

Mr Hendy: [reads:] 'Super Inn Skins' - that's nice.

         [Suddenly a Hawaiian band comes through the door and
         surrounds Mr and Mrs Hendy at their table, before leaving
         them to their own devices, which are not many. There is
         a long silence.]

Waiter: Good evening... would you care for something to talk about?

         [He hands them each a menu card with a list of subjects
         on.]

Mr Hendy: Oh that would be wonderful.

Waiter: Our special tonight is minorities...

Mr Hendy: Oh that sounds interesting...

Mrs Hendy: What's this conversation here...?

Waiter: Oh that's football... you can talk about the Steelers-Bears
    game, Saturday... or you could reminisce about really great
    World Series -

Mrs Hendy: No... no, no.

Mr Hendy: What's this one here?

Waiter: That's philosophy.

Mrs Hendy: Is that a sport?

Waiter: No it's more of an attempt to construct a viable hypothesis
    to explain the Meaning of Life.

         [The fish in the tank suddenly prick up their fins.]

Fish: What's he say, eh?

Mr Hendy: Oh that sounds wonderful... Would you like to talk about
    the Meaning of Life, darling...?

Mrs Hendy: Sure, why not?

Waiter: Philosophy for two?

Mr Hendy: Right...

Waiter: You folks want me to start you off?

Mr Hendy: Oh really we'd appreciate that...

Waiter: OK. Well er... look, have you ever wondered just why you're
    here?

Mr Hendy: Well... we went to Miami last year and California the
    year before that, and we've...

Waiter: No, no... I mean why *we're* here. On this planet?

Mr Hendy: [guardedly]... N... n... nope.

Waiter: Right! Have you ever *wanted* to know what it's all about?

Mr Hendy: [emphatically] No!

Waiter: Right ho! Well, see, throughout history there have been
    certain men and women who have tried to find the solution to
    the mysteries of existence.

Mrs Hendy: Great.

Waiter: And we call these guys 'philosophers'.

Mrs Hendy: And that's what we're talking about!

Waiter: Right!

Mrs Hendy: That's neat!

Waiter: Well you look like you're getting the idea, so why don't I
    give you these conversation cards - they'll tell you a little
    about philosophical method, names of famous philosophers...
    there y'are. Have a nice conversation!

Mr Hendy: Thank you! Thank you very much.

         [He leaves.]

Mrs Hendy: He's cute.

Mr Hendy: Yeah, real understanding.

         [They sit and look at the cards, then rather formally and
         uncertainly Mrs Hendy opens the conversation.]

Mrs Hendy: Oh! I never knew that *Schopenhauer* was a
    *philosopher*...

Mr Hendy: Oh yeah... He's the one that begins with an S.

Mrs Hendy: Oh...

Mr Hendy: ... Um [pause]... like Nietzsche...

Mrs Hendy: Does Nietzsche begin with an S?

Mr Hendy: There's an S in Nietzsche...

Mrs Hendy: Oh wow! Yes there is. Do all philosophers have an S in
    them?

Mr Hendy: Yeah I think most of them do.

Mrs Hendy: Oh!... Does that mean Selina Jones is a philosopher?

Mr Hendy: Yeah... Right, she could be... she sings about the
    Meaning of Life.

Mrs Hendy: Yeah, that's right, but I don't think she writes her own
    material.

Mr Hendy: No. Maybe Schopenhauer writes her material?

Mrs Hendy: No... Burt Bacharach writes is.

Mr Hendy: There's no 'S' in Burt Bacharach...

Mrs Hendy: ... Or in Hal David...

Mr Hendy: Who's Hal David?

Mrs Hendy: He writes the lyrics, Burt just writes the tunes... only
    now he's married to Carole Bayer Sager...

Mr Hendy: Oh... Waiter... this conversation isn't very good.

Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry, sir... We *do* have one today that's not on
    the menu. It's a sort of... er... speciality of the house.
    Live Organ Transplants.

Mrs Hendy: Live Organ Transplants? What's *that*?

                    LIVE ORGAN TRANSPLANTS

[A photo of the Emperor Haile Selassie hangs on the wall of a
suburban house. Upstairs 'Hava Nagila' is being played on a lone
violin. The door bell rings.]

Mr Bloke: Don't worry dear, I'll get it!

         [He opens the door.]

Mr Bloke: Yes!

First Man: Hello, er can we have your liver...?

Mr Bloke: My what?

First Man: Your liver... it's a large glandular organ in your
    abdomen... you know it's a reddish-brown and it's sort of -

Mr Bloke: Yes, I know what it is, but I'm using it.

Second Man: Come on sir... don't muck us about.

         [They move in.]

Mr Bloke: Hey!

         [They shut the door behind him.]

         [The first man makes a grab at his wallet and finds a
         card in it.]

First Man: Hallo! What's this then...?

Mr Bloke: A liver donor's card.

First Man: Need we say more?

Second Man: No!

Mr Bloke: Look, I can't give it to you now. It says 'In The Event
    of Death'...

First Man: No-one who has ever had their liver taken out by us has
    survived...

         [The second man is rummaging around in a bag of clanking
         tools.]

Second Man: Just lie there, sir. it won't take a minute.

         [They throw him onto the dining room table and, without
         any more ceremony, start to cut him open. A rather sever
         lady appears at the door.]

Mrs Bloke: 'Ere, what's going on?

First man: He's donating his liver, madam...

Mr Bloke: Aarrgh... oh!... aaargh ow! Ow!

Mrs Bloke: Is this because he took out one of those silly cards?

First Man: That's right, madam.

Mr Bloke: Ow! Oooh! Oohh! Oh... oh... God... aargh aargh...

Mrs Bloke: Typical of him. He goes down to the public library -
    sees a few signs up... comes home all full of good intentions.
    He gives blood... he does cold research... all that sort of
    thing.

Mr Bloke: Aaaagh... oh... aaarghh!

Mrs Bloke: What d'you do with them all anyway?

Second man: They all go to saving lives, madam.

Mr Bloke: Aaaaargh! Oh... ow! Oh... oh my God!

Mrs Bloke: That's what *he* used to say... it's all for the good of
    the country, he used to say.

Mr Bloke: Aaaargh!... Ow! Ooh!

Mrs Bloke: D'*you* think it's *all* for the good of the country?

First Man: Uh?

Mrs Bloke: D'*you* think it's *all* for the good of the country?

First Man: Well I wouldn't know about that, madam...we're just
    doing our jobs, you know...

Mr Bloke: Owwwwweeeeeeeeeh! Ow!

Mrs Bloke: You're not doctors, then?

First Man: Oh!... Blimey no...!

         [The second man grins and raises his eyes as he digs
         around in the stomach. They laugh. A head comes round the
         door... It's a young man.]

Young Man: Mum, Dad,... I'm off out... now. I'll see you about
    seven...

Mrs Bloke: Righto, son... look after yourself.

Mr Bloke: Aaargh... ow! Oh... aaargh aargh!

Mrs Bloke: D'you er... fancy a cup of tea...?

First Man: Oh well, that would be very nice, yeah... Thank you,
    thank you very much madam. Thank you. [Aside.] I thought she'd
    never ask...

         [She takes him into the kitchen... shuts the door. She
         bustles about preparing the tea...]

    You do realise... he has to be... well... dead... by the terms
    of the card... before he donates his liver.

Mrs Bloke: Well I told him that... but he never listens to me...
    silly man.

First Man: Only... I was wondering what you was thinking of doing
    after that... I mean... will you stay on your own or... is
    there someone else... sort of... on the horizon...?

Mrs Bloke: I'm too old for that sort of thing. I'm past my prime...

First Man: Not at all... you're a very attractive woman.

Mrs Bloke: [laughs a little] Well... I'm certainly not thinking of
    getting hitched up again...

First Man: Sure?

Mrs Bloke: Sure.

First Man: [coming a little closer] Can we have your liver then?

Mrs Bloke: No... I don't want to die.

First Man: Oh come on, it's perfectly natural. Only take a couple
    of minutes.

Mrs Bloke: Oh... I'd be scared.

First Man: All right, I'll tell you what. Look, listen to this -

         [A man in pink evening dress emerges from the fridge.]

Man in Pink Evening Dress: Whenever life gets you down, Mrs Brown
    And things seem hard or tough
    And people are stupid obnoxious or daft
    And you feel that you've had quite enough...

[As he starts to sing, the wall of the kitchen disintegrates to
reveal a magnificent night sky. The vocalist in pink escorts Mrs
Bloke up into the stars.]

    Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
    And revolving at 900 miles an hour,
    That's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
    A sun that is the source of all our power.
    The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see,
    Are moving at a million miles a day
    In an outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
    Of the galaxy we call the Milky Way.

    Our galaxy itself contains 100 billion stars
    It's 100,000 light years side to side.
    It bulges in the middle, 16,000 light years thick
    But out by us its just 3,000 light years wide
    We're 30,000 light years from galactic central point,
    We go round every 200 million years
    And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
    In this amazing and expanding Universe.

    The Universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
    In all of the directions it can whizz
    As fast as it can go, at the speed of light you know,
    12 million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there
         is.
    So remember when you're feeling very small and insecure
    How amazingly unlikely is your birth
    And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space
    Because there' bugger all down here on earth.

    [The vocalist in pink climbs back into the fridge and the door
    slams to.]

Mrs Bloke: Makes you feel so sort of insignificant, doesn't it?

First Man: Yeah yeah... Can we have your liver, then?

Mrs Bloke: Yeah. All right, you talked me into it.

First Man: Eric!

         [A lettering artist is just finishing painting the words
         'Liver Donors Inc' onto a wall plaque enumerating all the
         subsidiaries of the Very Big Corporation of America.]

Chairman: [of the Very Big Corporation of America]... which brings
    us once again to the urgent realisation of just how much there
    is still left to own. Item 6 on the Agenda, the Meaning of
    Life... Now Harry, you've had some thoughts on this...

Harry: That's right, yeah. I've had a team working on this over the
    past few weeks, and what we've come up with can be reduced to
    two fundamental concepts... One... people are not wearing
    enough hats. Two... matter is energy; in the Universe there
    are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive. Some
    energies have a spiritual source which act upon a person's
    soul. However, this soul does not exist *ab inito*, as
    orthodox Christianity teaches; it has to be brought into
    existence by a process of guided self-observation. However,
    this is rarely achieved owing to man's unique ability to be
    distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia.

         [Pause.]

Max: What was that about hats again?

Harry: Er... people aren't wearing enough.

Chairman: Is this true?

Edmund: [who is sitting next to Harry] Certainly. Hat sales have
    increased, but not *pari passu... as our research -

Bert: When you say 'enough', enough for what purpose...?

Gunther: Can I ask with reference to your second point, when
